0,"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:- You need amazon prime account  for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software  and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products."

¬†Works beautifully, have bought 3 to link the entire house. Frequently group and play them together, use drop in to create an intercom, and have linked to speakers, bulbs, TV and other gadgets. I would still give this only 3 stars because it is double the rate here in India compared to the US. A country with 25 TIMES India's per capita income. What is this pricing Amazon? I understand there may be taxes in India but still. 2X the price ?This not withstanding will buy a larger Echo speaker whenever there is a sale on Echo with reasonable prices."

¬†Bought this and wipro 9w smart bulb in combo offer. Configured smart bulb in alexa. Cool thats it.Just say ""alexa, lights on"", ""alexa, turn light to red / blue"" etc.. you can alse even change the brightness ""alexa, change the brightness to 50%"" etc. You will get the manual within the wipro bulb box. There you can see the list of commands.Lets see the other options of echo dot. I connected this to home theater. It is just playing songs from any music station, my playlist. Tried these 2 options only. Mostly i play rhymes. Around INR 2500, i got this combo. Worth to play around."
3,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360¬∞ view.8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.9. Can fit into confined space.10. Also paid only ‚Çπ1999.What more one can ask for."
4,"I am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy.1. I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen. Sound quality is amazing.2. It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot3. One thing disappointed is that when say 'Alexa, play old telugu songs' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs'(not telugu old songs). When I specially say 'Alexa play telugu retro station songs' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.I will update the review after days again but it's 5 star rating for now"
5,For 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA.  So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!!  Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers.  This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness.  While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that.  Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times.  Just grab this before it goes back to its old price.  Even the smart bulb is very helpful.  While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb.  Just go for it before its too late
6,"""Worst experience brought it on 12th August already stopped working since 25th September @Amazon what should be done suggest""This was my previous review but now i am amazed with customer service i got from Amazon. The adaptor for Alexa was faulty..so after the review Amazon came to know about my problem and without any delay they help me with a new adaptor without any cost.In this way within a day my issue is resolved. Thankyou Mr.Aman for your promp response and solution will never forget it.so all these stars are not for Alexa now but for Amazon üôÇu won my ‚ù§Ô∏è"
7,"me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I do not know that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I could not find that""me ""Alexa,  play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I don't recognize it""search capabilities of Alexa sucks!! Even when I read out the playlist names as they are on Amazon Music, Alexa can't find those playlists. Alexa know a standard playlists like 90s bollywood, bollywood hits etc., If you are looking for Kannada playlists or for that matter any local language lists, Alexa just does not know...me ""Alexa, I have feedback"" ""You really suck!!"""
8,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)The software front is just average.If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose."
9,"The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]). P.P.S.-Amit Bachchan's voice is now available via Amitji keyword but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it :)"
10,"Well amazon did a great job they explain every pros on their details*Only thing is alexa is in beta stage may be it will take some more years for this AI to work like google assistant, because most of the time alexa says "" ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§ù‡•á ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§™‡§§‡§æ""*Interaction in hindi is better than google assistant*Sould quality is better than my expectations*Got it on amazon GIF with wipro bulb @2300rs with 100 of cashback ‚úåüèª* in winter season i don't need to go out from my quilt to switch of my home devices üòÇüòÇ Thanks amazon* Good for my parents as they can ask most of the things to alexa because they r in a phase of learning smartphones features* Only buy if u heave a wifi router, will not work good with mobile hot-spot* Smart devices most of them only supports 2.4Ghz wifi router* Smart devices cost a lot as compare to normal electronics, with this speaker u need to spend extra bucks to make your home more smarterPS- Add motion sensing LED to ur home with smart LED ... It looks cool and u dont need to shout a lot to turn it off or on and the bottom line is they r more cheaper ‚úåüèª"

¬†Got it with Wipro smart LED bulb bundle. In 1999 both.Pros:Solid build quality.Easy setup.Capture voice even far from 10 feet.Loud and clear sound.Bass is awesome.Easy connection to your smart LED bulb.Capture all voice just anybody called ""Alexa"". It will respond.Cons:No battery inside, you need to put in its power adapter all the time.Works only if active internet connection available.You should have wifi at home to connect all devices together."
12,"worst product amazon released into market in a hurry. Here are some, if not all, of the issues:1 - No sound clarity. Even from 4 feet one cant understand what alexa saying. muffled voice2 - Limited capability. Other than weather it doesn't know any significant much. I didnt buy it for weather or switch on a bulb.3 - Dont understand english language properly.4 -Its useless overall for anything and for anyone, be it kids or adults.Amazon has a long way to go before it can make it usefull."
13,"This device refused to set up because the Alexa app just didn't work on my mother's phone. I had bought this for her. I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in  that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller."
14,"I am returning after trying various commands for about a week. This is a recent review.Received only 2 days ago. So initial impressions.Not checked integration. Oakremote that I purchased with Echo was a flop.+ves -Voice recognition , Quick response, Family is having fun giving commands-ves: It generally plays music from Amazon music library. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sounds like 19th century radio. It works only when Wifi and Electricity are available.I am keeping it for the novelty and as a sample of future AI. Would be happy if it lasted atleast till 2022 Diwaliüòú"

¬†Overall good quality it is baby rhymes songs and also controls geyser doing well with compared to other versions this is economical and technically goodrecommended for others to buy"
16,"I like Alexa and the features. But rated 3 due to the below facts.- No inbuilt battery. A big minus. In today's mobile world, you cannot enforce the device to be plugged in always.- No USB charging facility- Alexa app is horribly slow- The moment your wifi connection changes, it cannot detect. You need to reconfigure itPlus features- Device shape is great- Sound quality is superb- Voice response is awesome"
17,"It‚Äôs an amazing product to have, especially the integration with your google calendar and tons of skills to play around with. Though hoping there will be more better software updates, butIt‚Äôs a bang on product for the price. Bought wipro bulb and echo dot together for 2449Rs and then returned the wipro bulb and got back 700Rs. So got the Alexa for just 1750Rs, which is truely a bang on for a smart assistant and a Bluetooth speaker ;)"
18,"In comparison with Google voice assistant devices -1. Eco dot 3 is awesome in hardware - mic recognises voice from far away distance and bass on speaker is super.2. But software experience is pathetic due to alexa which is not even 10% of google assistant. Very limited recognition of command and that too hit or miss by alexa.3. Alexa catches one command unlike combined commands in Google assistant.4. Unproductive things like telling jokes are only features of alexa. It can't even calculate dates.On/off smart plug & reminders are the only perfectly working things with Alexa !!!In layman terms - Google is hero and Alexa is joker.Limitations in speaker -Note that only 3.5mm output is possible, so eco dot 3 can't be used as 3.5mm speaker but can be used as Bluetooth speaker.You can't use mic in Bluetooth mode. So, not usable for calls.Alexa app -is inconsistent and not user-friendly. Critical features like alexa guard are not available in India.Voice recognition -It's always hit or miss with simple commands also.I bought to play online kannada music but voice recognition is limited to Bollywood movie names or artists for Indian music.It won't recognise 99% kannada music/movie/artist names.My VERDICT -Even though I got in DEC 2021 for 2299, I'm finding it useless. My usage is restricted to on/off smart plug at water heater and reminders, as reminders with 5 out 5 times whereas it's 4/5 with Google.Alexa ignored Kannada and all other South Indian languages, so time for us to ignore alexa and go with Google devices if South Indian languages are your need.Don't waste your money on alexa voice assistant devices."
19,"The product has intermittent issue while connecting with Phone for playing videos sound.  Spoke with Amazon Tech support, they went ahead with raising replacement after some troubleshooting. Now, they picked the device. Though no replacement update.  Nothing in the app which indicates that the product has been picked up or replacement has been sent.Moreover the device itself dont have connectivity with ZOOM app and for calling  in India. Though the feature is available in other countries through Echo Connect feature.Hope they will sent the replacement."

¬†I used hardly six months and getting crack sound from speaker. It happened to couple of other friends too. And service is very pathetic. I have booked service and no one called me back. Better to go for Google one which is very reliable. This is not for long term usage. Amazon making fools with duplicate products."
21,"Alexa is horribly wrong and Dumb..I made a mistake by not buying google mini speaker..Alexa has no answers...It is a stupid speaker..I know u need to enable the skills and all that..However, it is still a very bad Assistant..Fully disssatisfied..Audio quality is good but one can buy a simple bluetooth speaker at 1/3rd the cost rather than messing ur mind up with such an incapable AI speaker.. It cannot answer 90% of your questions.Used with Fireststick: limited usage and that too with limited apps.Will still need the remote anyway. Not much useful with Firestick.I strongly suggest please Buy google home mini instead..Audio may be a bit less but the google assistant is amazing.."
22,"We purchased Gen3.  The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings.  App has a very poor design and functionality.  Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker.  Overall, good to hear music.  AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions.  Good for wakeup alarms and listening music.  Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown.  Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify.  Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube.  Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb.  These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt."

¬†i like the product.its sound quality is awesome but can not recognize my voice properly.i have to speak multiple time. if you want a speaker go for it,don't expect anything else.i think it will going to improve in future but for now its only a expensive speaker. ita a made in china product.i returned it to the seller"

¬†Sound quality is good,fast response,easy to use.it is a good product and for those who are not much aware about the technology they can also operate easily.you can listen news and if you are feeling bored alexa can tell you good jokes.i m also using wipro smart bulb with Alexa and it is working awesome.i found only one issue sometimes alexa does not respond I think because when we give command from long distance I mean because of mic but overall good product."
25,"Everytime I connect to the device it says playing from and mentions my device name. This comes at high volume as this volume can only be controlled through the device. But this doesn't end here. Alexa shouts playing from and my device name everytime. If I lock my system and re-login then it shouts this message. If I stay idle and don't move my mouse for 5 mins and then move it then I get this mesaage again. Sometimes it happens when I am playing videos as well. A video will be playing and suddenly Alexa shouts playing from and my device name. Unfortunately even though I tried many things to get rid of that, I wasn't able to get rid of this sound till now. When I connect to Alexa speaker for the first time it doesn't connect properly and it plays with breaking sounds. This happens many times and I have to keep disconnecting and connecting it back till it works properly. Overall it is a fine speaker but there are too many problems that I face everyday with it."
26,"In a word... Just fabulous...Not that much works in queries like Google. But GK level is quite good.For music it's outstanding.Voice recognition, sound quality, the LED ring ... All experiences are just awesome.Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.But After all these ifs & buts... Me & my family members like it very much.."
27,"I bought this as a productivity tool- during the pandemic while I drift between office work and housework, I need something to remind me of upcoming tasks or meetings.  It fails terribly due to lack of  thinking by the designers.1. This devise should require  a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further.  It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders  or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed. 2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer.  Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results4. The reminders should  have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying ""acknowledged' or 'done'"
28,"My perception about ambient computing changed after I bought this alexa device and Iam loving this device.Alexa's voice is a bigger USP , such a soothing voiceBest WFH home companionLook up alexa skills and you will be facinated how many thousand skills it has,Check out Alexa skills in amazon website & in alexa mobileAlexa is a platform and Amazon making it better everydayThese are early days of ambient computing and no assistants are perfectYou can use google assistant from ur phone via bluetooth to get essential from google assistantSpeaker Sound quality is decent and won't  hurt your ears.Amazon adding more songs to  Amazon music and if you have prime subscription you are gonna enjoySpotify integration with Alexa is intuitive with free spotify accountWe can set out Alexa routines and blueprint feature is awesomeIOT connectivity  is seemlessAlexa reads news from Ndtv , TOI, ET, and more.Alexa market share is more than google nest,so developers line up for alexa than googleThank you amazon for creating this best Alexa speakerMuch loveAlexa user"
29,"This review is after using echo dot gen 3 more than 2 months. While there are both Pros and Cons, this is a good device to enter into connected devices world.Pros:1. Good looking gels nicely with the environment.2. LED ring gets your attention when in need.3. Good sound quality on playback.Cons so far:1. Sound is muffled for the responses from Alexa, you can't make out clearly on what it says most of the time. No fix yet { reduced one star because of this. }. Due to this issues it's being used as just a music player most of the time.2. Compared to Google Mini, Alexa's search contextual hits are lower.3. Was unable to get Follow-up working properly."
30,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.Update:After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling itout, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money."
31,"The integration with other app is difficult and many times it unable to perform well with voice recoginitionFlaws:1.Its difficult to pair it with smart switch and bulbs.i was not successful,in doing so2.voice recognition sucks3.the help provided ia not good at all.not a good assistqnt.4.cannot plqy music or video from yputube5.no proper help for automating6.cannot use it as output speaker with my projector7. Simple automation scripts for pairing should be provided as a sample so that ppl can directly reuse them8.it only search songs from limited platforms.that huge disappojntmentNot satisfied at all.Only thing that I like is sound of speaker"
32,"Got a sweet prime day combo deal on this and this is my second purchase of this device. For the price and the ease of use and integration, I am very happy with it. I only wish it had a chargeable feature to go alongside it to make it truly portable but I guess Amazon has other devices which cater to that need.I really haven't used the offerings from google and apple in this category so will not compare but just for itself, this device is a charm."
33,"Hello,I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference."
34,"Sound Quality was unexpected from such a small device with a single small speaker. I enjoy FM radio (through skill) everyday. This is very useful as analog FM reception in our area is very bad. Through skills it reminds me of my medication.  Command detection is mostly accurate. But when searching for music, it plays wrong songs at times may be because of the very limited music collection with amazon. Pairing with a second Bluetooth speaker using ""discover"" command is not working unless you remove the already paired device using Alexa app. I wish the alarms and reminders had user programmable/uploadable bells/voices as there is only one sound in the alarm settings."
35,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change.Update: January 10, 2021Almost two years since purchaseThe device is still as good as it was when bought. However, it seems Amazon has made no efforts to improve their music libraries. Their focus is still only to cater to the youth, not those who love soft soulful music. When I ask Alexa to play songs of Md. Rafi, for example, she will only play noisy ones like ""Chaahe koyi mujhe jungle kahe..."". She will never include songs like ""Ik haseen shaam ko dil mera kho gayaa..."" even if the song is available in Amazon Music. The Amazon team thinks only college goers listen to its music. This is one of the reasons why I can not recommend Amazon's voice assisted speakers to friends."
36,I brought two speakers on a sale. Waited for a few months to install when we move to our new home. And placed them in a cardboard box which contains a lot of cardboard boxes of electronics. Termites are attracted to the amazon echo boxes and made a mess and ate almost all the three echo dot boxes. And most interestingly the remaining boxes are stood firm. I don't know what to do now. Please help me Amazon.
37,1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.
38,"Sidhi si bat he iska pure use to sirf jo total sirf computer job vale hi kar shakte he baki to sab sholh k liye lete he,baki normal speakers ki tarah hi use hoga sound limited he ek room k hisab se, baki special search nahi karta kuchh only Amazon, Amazon prime music ,hungama,jese 3 se 5 platforms ko hi use karta he,baki puchho ge to javab milega iske bare me mobile app m jaye ,bss baki shokh pura karo baki naya kuchh nahi lagega"
39,I ordered echo dot gift twin pair with smart bulb...Today I received my order and got single echo with smart bulb.. and no customer service number is reachable..
40,"This is the first Echo I have owned. So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music. It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights. That being said I am wondering why in the world, it being an amazon product, does it not control my amazon fire stick! This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option! It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick. This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars."
41,Speaker is good for news and music to some extent But it is worst when Alexa speaks. She sounds muffled and its difficult to understand especially when fan or ac is on The Equalizer wud not manage Alexa's speech it's only for news music etc. Very inconvenientI have 3 echo devices and homepod but Alexa is supercool as an assistant. Problem is only with echo dot 3rd gen. You can go for better echo models. I wud recommend to test it out first then make a buying decision
42,"After 3 months here are the things which I found.Works better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbps.I have started to get few bugs or software issue.Alexa listens sometimes by itself and says, 'sorry, I don't know that.'Sometimes songs stops playing in middle by itself.It doesn't recognise voice even after activating it many times.After command it doesn't follow.Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.The sound has decreased, now at volume level 3 I can't hear music properly after 3 meters range. (Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)Amazon please send a software update which solves these.Thanks!"
43,"The Echo Dot 3rd Gen is comparatively good that than it's predecessor. The sound quality is improved, however there are two things that I would like to being to the notice of it's manufacturer or would say the developers rather. The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it's very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it's integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it's good."
44,"Don't buy this product if you are not a Amazon prime member.This will work only prime members.I was happy to hear the voice of Alexa that's it. After that what ever I command to Alexa only reply is, this is for prime members.Expect whether report this device don't deliver anything.Planning to return it tomorrow.Please don't get into traps like this.Today they are telling to be a prime member tomorrow they may say upgrade it by paying some money.Thanks Amazon for trapping me. But I won't let others to get trap."

46,"I order this product and the seller was Cloutrail, when I opened the sealed box from amazon it was ok, however the echo dot product box was double sealed.1.The actual horizontal seal was opened before and then the seller had sealed it with normal cello-tape as mentioned in the pic above.2.The manuals inside was not place properly inside the box, as I am 100 per sure this has been opened and used by seller.3. The charging cable of the adapter was in tangled state, and the binding rubber of the wire was not even inside the box.3. The plastic seal was not present in the device. (on the top of interface)4. Even while setting up, I had to reset it to complete the installationWhy did you sent a refurbished product when I ordered for a new one??I will make sure Amazon pays for this!!"
47,"Using a proprietry power connector for power supply is a big flaw for indian market, where power outage is common, I have my speakers and modem connected with a ups and i am forced to keep alexa at the same place where it doesnt pickup my voice most of the time. A Micro usb port would have been better. I can connect a powerbank to it to make this device portable. In that sense i think google mini is better"
48,Product is good but if a perforated box had been given then it would have been good so that we could have ensured that there is no dust entry and when we operate it because of perforations sound should not be a problem and also the box should have a provision to insert the plug.In this way we could have kept in a place where there is no dust entryMay be for futureregards
49,"Well, it certainly does few things but way to go. I don't understand with all the money and talent Amazon has, why they didn't provide simple skill to under stand simple commands like Enter/Select, Go up, Go down etc. so that we can use it proper remote.Pros:1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.Cons:1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.2. Misses the command now and then.3. Difficult to give voice command while there are other sounds around like if you are watching TV of listening to music. That's very frustrating as you cannot pause video if sound coming from TV is high."
50,"Within 3 months of purchasing the sound has begun to distort, even at 5 or 6 level I can here unusual sound. I don't know what to do. My return window is already closed.Secondly, song searching on Gaana app is very poor. I am very fond of Riya's Retro, but Alexa can search only season 1 and moreover it doesn't recognize different episodes of season 1 either. Means if you have already gone through 4-5 episodes of Riya's Retro and want to listen to the next episode, you have to start from episode 1 and then have to skip the episode you have already gone through. It takes hell lot of time to play the next episode after you give the voice command ""Next"".AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE MY ECHO DOT."
51,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The software stops working after a few months. This generation of echo dot is not worth spending money."
52,"Simply great product. Well built and very worth it. The voice recognition is great and works as intended most of the time. It keeps getting better as you use it. The sound really surprised me for its size. It's definately not a premium sound but it's still very bassy and loud, and full volume there is noticible disturbunce. The home automation part is what really makes this worth it though. I have my lights, tv and ac connected (using oakter remote) and ofcourse it's also an alarm, an intercom, a music player, a smart assistant and so much more. Life changing tech this is. I also like that you can command it in hindi and english. The conversations to be had are funny and almost natural. Software updates can/should make it even better. Wish it also had battery back up though, that's its biggest flaw. Soon I'll connect many other electronics in my house to alexa by way of smart switches."
53,Very useful to eradicate the lonely feeling at all times. Can hear any type of songs what we like.
54,"Edit...My mistake, This product does not come with batteryBeware guys check the device immediately for malfunction as you have only 10 days to return.I loved the device for its sound quality and voice recognition even from far. A full 5 starSad, I was not available at home during the 10 days return policy period and hence could not check. When I connected the device after returning, I found it is working only when power cable is connected despite charging for 6 hours as suggested.Later when I browsed their online help, I found a light should be blinking while charging which was not happening.Now it's not a portable device for me anymore. It will work only when connected to powerüò™"
55,"Works seamlessly.No issues so far.Never ignored what I said.Controlls AC, Computer Power, Lights, Music, etc. I'm so happy that I've an assistan that doesn't need any salary."
56,Great service at a great price. Thank you Amazon.The voice recognition is pretty good. But for this price you get a speaker quality which is decent. Not really so great. You can take it around with you wherever you go. We like to keep it in the hall which is large but it works power pretty well and covers the whole hall. The volume is loud enough for a big room for sure.

¬†Mindblowing purchase in every respect."
58,"Scenario:Connect your iPhone11 with JBL Go and Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation via blue toothBoth device should be connected. This you can verify it on Bluetooth menuPlay any songs from iTunes and let the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation decodes it(audio is playing on Amazon Echo Dot)Listen the audio for sometime (5 minutes approximately)Observation:Audio drops is observed and blue tooth get disconnected automaticallyIn the same scenario, if the audio is playing on JBL Go. The problem is not observedIf only Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation only connected to the phone everything works fineThe same problem is not observed with iPad Mini and Android phone"
59,"I felt the sound quality is great at the price of 2249 during sale. The alexa integration is really good with all the amazing alexa skills available in echo dot. The voice recognition is average coz when the volume is above 5 , alexa couldn't recognize the wake word as the music is loud. So, we would require to shout to let her hear the wake word. I hope this might be resolved in the new (4th) generation as the sound will be focusing in 1 direction rather than 360 degrees, this is what i feel through looking at the design. The response time is good but can be improved in thr next generation yet to be released. Overall, this device is worth the purchase at regular price and during the sale it becomes much more worthy at the price of 2249. There are many hidden features in alexa which are not known by the majority customers like explicit filter, treble base and mid-range regulator, talk slow, talk fast, follow-up mode, sing a song, feedback, Horoscope, movie dialogues, quotes, Translation,  excellent mind and strategy games, kids games and fun games like Shadow game, Akinator, Bulls and Cows, Guess the number, Music mania, Yes Sire etc. and many more fabulous features. Please do a little search on Google about Alexa Skills and who knows you may be able to discover some great hidden features or a new feature. Also, at regular intervals, please do ask your alexa to check for software updates and update the device. It will allow you to enjoy new features with every update. Although, Alexa may not be the greatest invention but it is definitely the sweetest invention and yes it's becoming smarter everyday. Alexa is not comparable to other devices like google home, google nest, apple homepod, etc. as they have different features and different price segments. If you need a wide range of features and skills for daily use and fun, Alexa devices are the perfect choices. Believe me, even with those flaws i mentioned, Alexa will be a cheer. Just go for it."
60,"If you‚Äôre in the market for a cheap wireless speaker that can make calls, control your smart home and play the occasional song or two, the Amazon Echo Dot is easily one of the best smart speakers on the market for you ‚Äì even better than the Google Home Mini in terms of call quality and music playback."
61,"I'm very happy with my purchase.Initially it feels little bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it.Later on talking to Alexa becomes a part of your daily life.‚úÖThings which I like the most are stated below:üëçThe sound quality is very good.üëçYou get good depth of sound.üëçYou can ask any random questions to Alexa.üëçIt can speak and understand Hindi and English languages.üëçIt does play all musics from all languages.üëçIt can tell jokes.üëçI also played KBC with Alexa.‚ùåThings which I don't like are:üëéSometimes it is unable to understand what you said.üëéMost of time Alexa reply ""Sorry"" because she don't know the answers of our command/questions.üëéIt is a good music player but poor assistant.üëéIt plays certain songs again and again and doesn't let you skip.üëéYou have to set a play list in your phone or device from which you are operating Alexa. Otherwise you will keep on saying ""Alexa play this song. Alexa play that song.""üëéIf you won't set any playlist it will stop after every song.üëéIt is not battery powered.üëéhas to be kept plugged in all the time."
62,"I got the device and wipro smart bulb for 2k on freedom sale which I think is too good deal.Sound quality of the speaker is awesome.Very loud and Good amount bass it produces to fill the room.Software is not that great and voice recognition is very poor.Sometimes it won't responds.Responses are very limited and most of times it doesn't responds at all make me go mad.You can create routines of your like, editable in Alexa app.Aux connectivity helps you to connect with your home theater."
63,"Writing again since I am totally unsatisfied with Alexa and it became a useless item for me . Unable to add skills pertaining to choice of music . When i bought Alexa, lot of expectations , but it is not at all impressive on various areas, like when I ask Alexa to play malayalam songs , based on movies,singers,by song name, it is always gives an answer sorry I could not see any song. Same stands with Tamil and to an extend hindi songs as well.Google Home is much smarter and better choice than Aelxa. I strongly suggest if Amazon is not fixing this basic issues and needs of many in India, you may always got a better option 'Google Home'."

¬†Never realised that Alexa was this amazing until I purchased one.If you have a proper WiFi connection at homeIf you have smart devices and controllable electronics Alexa is a must have device for you. Go for it. Over a month of experiencing the hands free way of performing multiple tasks Alexa has been an incredible device and software for my everyday use. The speakers are really great for the price we pay. Go for it.I have purchased 3 unites and over all this is worth it"
65,What a product.. U think of a song and say it.. Alexa actually can play the exact song to the 100% accuracy.Sound quality is awesome with this small sized powerpack. Romantic and slow songs music are just lovable. Although if u like badhash or some hip hop music. U can use an additonal speaker and connect this to it..Mics are quite sensitive and can take orders from other room. Only at high volume u need to yell still not but a concern though.Product build quality excellent.Just an amazing product. U will sure love it.Day 10 and still exploring it. My kid loves to interact with it and ask almost anything and he is excited.
66,"Superb AI device coupled with great speakers. The first impression might seems like underpowered, but the sound quality & volume packs a punch. Children love it. It is able to understand most of the stuff & respond quickly. Mostly depends on amazon music for the songs. Only point is, if it can have battery back up, would have been truly awesome."
67,My first Smart SpeakerThis was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English
68,"I ordered echo dot hoping it will help me in organizing the daily routines and provide responses to day to day questions especially for kids. Later came to know , most of the features lack the basic intelligence. Alex doesnt understand the context most of the times. you cant ask a question which is linked to a previous query/answer. Many times it tries to find a song only. !!! It acts desgned for a music playbox most time.Getting a song played out that we intent (sung by my fav singer) is almost no way in many cases. Reminders - voice level cannot be set so I end up creating Routines instead. Many times my kid asks queries and it gives foolish answers. There are no good stories we can get to hear unless we pay for another subscription other than  the prime. !!!.  The definition it gives is mostly from wikiepedia which it thinks as source of truth.!!.Many times I felt throwing the device to the floor. In a nutshell , this is a dumb musical player created by Amazon SW team. There is no element of intelligence to it. They just integrated it with routines and we can do those  routines  and play the song (the one , that it decides) . Amazon product team ihasnt improved this device at all in the new generation model."
69,"I bought this on Jan 25 and it was working great, the voice recognition is good, alexa software sucks and sound quality was also good (not for long). Now its 20 days and the speaker started creating buzzy sounds. At the beginning it was low, but as the time passes, the buzzing sound is also increased. Won't recommend it happily to someone."
70,"The device is quite unique and affordable. It has 4 mics and a really good speaker. You can set alarms, remainders and literally listen to every song. It uses less data while plugged in and about 100mb per hour to play songs and books. That means it literally uses less than 1-3gb per month. First of all Amazon has one of the best Customer Care services and customer friendly policies."
71,"Don't waste your money, it's just fun toy like that, if you talk local language then it's just sorry I don't understand and I don't know. It's only in Hindi and English language only and playing songs, there is no local language news also, it's to worst to bad don't buy and don't waste your money"
72,"Good product by Amazon,  very intelligent and responding also loudness is good you'll don't need any other speakers if the size of room is medium or small. Sound quality is good bass is ok. Answers thing correctly.Cons is ... sometimes if you're playing song with full sound & you're not close to the device then you have to shout.& You have to say things properly if you want alexa to work properly.Very entertaining device which you can use in different good ways n works... it helps alot.. Go for it if you're getting this in a good price.. otherwise go for 4th gen that one have very good quality speakers."
73,"Alexa is good in understanding the Indian accent and covering Hindi-English language , it does the job of voice assistant in terms of managing devices around... I tried controlling my Denon AVR X2500h with Alexa, it does the basic task of paying song, changing volume, but can't change the music mode etc. Similarly I can control my Airtel Internet TV set top box once set-top box is swith on, it can not swith it on or off.So it gets the work done upto certain extend but not completely.The biggest problem which is see with Echo devices is that it can not get the information from web though it is connected to internet always, for every thing to do it needs skill.Ideally it should go to web to find some basic answers instead of saying ""I don't know"".If anyone wants to use it just for playing music then this is one of the best smart speaker available in market in given price."
74,I was writing this review after three weeks of usage. I like sound quality in this echo device and very portable device.I dislike voice recognition is not good and whenever I turn on this device for first time it's not connecting to internet need to reset or start it again which makes us irritating everytime.Alexa has integrated to more things but some of the integration not working well.My rating for this product will be 2.5/5
75,Its a absolutely cheating for the customer. If we buy any amazon product . Definitely we want to buy amazon prime members also. In this case if any song want to play absolutely need amazon prime membership otherwise we cannot play music through any other app. No Google Apps are not working through amazon alexa. If anybody want to amazon Alexa . Go For GOOGLE HOME. Its have everything. And also free cost for all App
76,Pros.1. Sound quality considering its compact design2. Compact. Box is also pretty small hence good to carry even when you travel.3. Great features with lot of additional apps or featured addons4. Does pick up most of the commands very easilyCons1. Intial connectivity took lot of trail. Even though the internet is very fast.Tips.Place it on a wooden table for better bass delivery
77,Pros :1. Voice recognition: REALLY really good!!!!!( sorry for overacting but trust me it‚Äôs really good )2. Build quality. ( really durable and good!!!)3. Loudness : For this compact size and my requirements it more than enough .4. Sound quality : The audio is really amazing the vocals are crisp and clear .  The bass is really sufficient but not very much (like heavy bass) but it‚Äôs good and really good .Cons :1. Biggest con is it always has to be connected for functioning and here in India electricity cuts quite often which is really disturbing but whenever there is electricity it works so smoothly .So the conclusion is if you want speaker under 3000 with good sound quality you can go with this one .It Beates every other speaker in this price range for vocals and sound clarity EASILY!!!. But if you love bass and want a smart speaker that too  you can go with it‚Äôs upper model which has heavy bass as well and it‚Äôs around 3000-3200 it‚Äôs price differs but not more than 3200 . With offer you will get a smart bulb of 600-700 of only 100 which is also really good.( I missed that offer with my Alexa üò≠üò≠ü•≤ so don‚Äôt miss it .)
78,"This is a good device (or should I say a Toy). It works exactly as promised. So, no complaints over there.BUT,This is more like a toy to me. The day when I bought this I was very excited to use it but eventually my interest faded and now it is just lying around the house. I use it some times to listen to music nothing more because kab tak aap use weather ya news puchoge ya bate karoge. I even have a fire TV stick to pair it with and use voice commands but it is not perfect search so I end up using remote. I even have a wipro smart bulb but the story remians the same.YOU WILL EVENTUALLY (1 WEEK IN MY CASE) GET BORED WITH THIS TOY."
79,This is able to recognize Indian accent really well and the drop in function is helpful for calling the device to talk to the person near the device.  The smart plug can be scheduled and works seamlessly. Cons would be the sound is kindLoud but lacks clarity. The mid frequency needs to be tweeked for optimum clarity and rarely the device doesn't respond when we call Alexa
80,"Not happy it's an ok product  as it does not catch things fast, to add on Amazon prime would have worked better if it sinks in with you tube and Google along with added new features ( off old and new).Another annoying thing is it keeps giving the entire description (ex - song or any movie ) which cannot be put off.It's goes not have want I want."
81,"Dont fall for this. Though it feels good when it plays few songs however in most of the cases it wont recognize your voice. Also, at high volumes, you will keep on shouting Alexa, Alexa and it wont hear you.Just a stupid toy, may be for kids"
82,It worked good for about a month. But after that it started hanging. Now most of the times it doesn't recognise my words and many times it gets hanged while playing music. Wipro bulb camed with it also has the same situation. I keep its switch on but Alexa says that bulb is offline. Total waste of money.
83,"I did a lot of research and after much deliberation, I finally decided to go with Echo dot Gen 3 over Google Nest. I have to say, I am totally loving this. I have connected it to my Smart TV, Fire TV, Wipro Bulbs, Camera and Smart Sockets. Overall, I am satisfied and the device is working as expected. The only minus point is that the power cable is using old-style pin connector instead of mini USB which is more a universal standard."
84,"This is the second time that I have had to purchase this product, my first echo dot device stopped working and since it was not in warranty I was advised by AMAZON to send it to their CTDI team which handles out of warranty devices. My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a  new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem ."
85,Product was good but it was only for few months? After 1 year as warranty expired it stopped working suddenly and not even showing power sign or a blink. No idea how to get it repaired. Any option for trade-in for this please let me know
86,I got the echo dot on offer and excited to use but voice recognition is not working tried to restart and done troubleshooting steps but no use. Placed for replacement lets see what happens.The main feature of the app echo dot is alexa but for me that is not woorking.
87,"Wnna buy only smart speaker--googleWnna get an amazon atmosphere(prime,amazon music,fire tv etc,)--alexaFor a smart speaker its not that smart, nothing works without activating a skill and skills set (trust me not that great, sukhaa pada h yaar) if you only want a smart speaker üîä and you are heavily invested in amazon prime and fire tv stick like gadgets and you have other smart compatible devices and you need the help of amazon services very often only then go for it. Until used with amazon family its good but, if you want only a smart speaker then go for google home mini nest version you will be very happy. Alexa is just a very weak ai in front of google"
88,"My Nephew is in love with it. At first he was surprised how it could answer all his never ending questions. Now he is so attached with it and guess what we are also relieved now, we don't get so bugged by his all sorts of questions now. Some we knew some we had to research. Now he can himself find out his answers and use it as a PDA for himself.Update:I ordered second one for my another nephew's bday. Its great product to introduce technology to the kids."
89,"Looks like its quality is deliberately deteriorated to boos echo dot 4th Gen sales.- It has a problem picking up voice commands unless I shout on top of my voice- After it hears alexa, it gets stuck at times and doesn't respond to anything and just keeps blinking the blue light- Even the sound quality sounds artificialNot happy with the speaker"
90,"Database need to update, sometimes gives wrong answers, sometimes unable to understand the question and start giving different subjects description. I would like to suggest Amazon to update the Database urgently. one more thing the microfone is getting weaker than when i purchased."
91,"My son has been asking for a long time. However we weren't buying. This time, we decided to buy. It's an awesome product. we are astonished by its voice recognition capabilty. It's picks up right songs with minimal inputs.We have integrated it with fire stick also.No regrets...I recommend a buy ...Happy Alexaing :)"
92,"I ordered this product because it shows in web description as ""Echo Dot (3rd Gen)"".But when I connected to it with my alexa app, it shows Echo Dot ""2nd Gen"" instead of ""3rd Gen"".I am feeling like cheated."
93,"I got a faulty product. The lights were on for 5 mins..then all went off..there was no orange light...totally dissatisfied in 30 mins....Return Status: I applied for return on the same day that the product was delivered. The next day, i got a sms stating pick time was scheduled between 7 am to 7 pm which was ridiculous. Would the Amazon pickup service want someone to be in home for the whole day, just for receiving the pick up guy? I waited till 3pm and left for other imp service. Had an sms sent at the morning hrs about the approx pickup time, it would have been more meaningful. Totally, cheating and lethargic."
94,"Horrible music sound. Only good for speeches or weather reports, not for music. Bluetooth connectivity is a pain if you have multiple devices. Stationary use only (no battery). If you go and plug in another room, for example from living room to bedroom you have to start connectivity again from scratch. Alexa software is ages behind Google voice. I am returning this product. Good for a novelty, although you can get better items to show off for that price. Could not even recognize Gurgaon. Don‚Äôt be fooled by 3rd generation... just some more fancy lights. If the price drops after you buy it and take it somewhere else. You are basically left with price difference hanging around your neck! Rip off. Great for kids though!"
95,"I got this one during the Prime day sale. I have used this for a month now and below is my review.Pros:1. Excellent Speaker - both as a standalone speaker and smart device (at the price point i got on Prime day)2. Alexa - Has almost no trouble in recognizing voice and very rarely does it falter, plus integration with Amazon ecosystem - You can place order, track deliveries and also receive news updates all via Eco dot.3.  Bluetooth - Can even use this as a blue-tooth speaker for iPad / Phone . Does a great job (needs power source though)Cons:1. Portability : A removable USB cable on adapter would have enabled much wider usage (battery bank power?)2. One command at a time - It cannot execute 2 or 3 commands in one go - Like switch on the light, & play music will need you to say ""Alexa"" 2 times.  Can be a bit abrupt at times - in starting and stopping music etc.Verdict : Brilliant smart speaker for home use at a great price point."
96,"Very useful one, Luckily no Ads disturbs the Stotralu,Mantralu,Songs so can enjoy uninterruptedly. Audio Quality need to Improve, of course, in  Hugh volume it may OK, but we may not enjoy "" the High Volume Fir the sack of quality. More functions surprises us. Thank to the invented team."
97,"I m sorry to say that I was disappointed with this product. I know alexa is v popular with ppl who want to listen to songs. I wanted to listen to kirtan only but cudnt listen. It always played something different. Moreover, it was not linked to YouTube. Had no option but to return the same..."
98,"Common guys you need to fix the amazon music search results, I search for a song and it gives me a different results and I cant find the original song until I specifically mention the singer. Its very annoying when YouTube music works flawless, sadly there is no inter-compatibility with each other.Also why cant I change the voice, it sounds so robotic, make a better alternative, its one thing that's keeping me away from making it my default voice assistant.Everything else is just great. Sound has much more depth. Google home mini is tuned for better vocal response while echo is for music"
99,"They need to provide battery backup so that we can carry it anywhere.It needs to play songs randomly also like YouTube, instead of asking it to play. It might have this feature and I may be unaware so second comment can be ignored if it has it.I returned it as I wanted to play songs in my bathroom where there is no electric connection."
100,"I bought it for 3500 for 2 echo dots and 1 bulb. For this price its totally worth it. I really enjoyed using it and my sis has a toddler who is easily pacified using alexa light controls and songs (we have bought costlier toys but it's alexa who mostly saves the day). So for my home, It already did more than I paid for.üòåüòåüòå"
101,"The setup process is so tedious and when i tried to change network it just doesn't work. This isnt setup its like open setup and you might have a chance to set up the device successfully! Hurry! It really is so bad i am connected to amazon wcp network for hours Nothing happens, alexa just goes out of setup mode thats it. I cant do sheet. Tooooo bad and tiring and waste of time."
102,"Superb purchase made during the Great Indian Festival Sale by Amazon. I feel so good that I made a right decision of buying this wonderful product by Amazon. It's a small speaker but the sound is enough for a medium to large sized room. It connects with my home Wifi seamlessly.This smart speaker supports voice recognition and it can recognise my voice which is truly amazing.Sound quality is very good and it has a nice clear sound which is loud enough.Alexa integration is the main feature of this product, which is why it's a must-buy for every smarthome.The speaker connects to all my smart devices, namely, Amazon Fire Stick, Wipro Smart Bulb, Wipro Smart Batten, and Wipro Smarthome. It makes my life so easy!Alexa has a lot many supported apps and the number is increasing everyday. You get a lot of interesting apps to use with Alexa. For example, you can order Uber cabs, ask time, play a game, listen to music and what not. This speaker truly leverages the power of Amazon Alexa."
103,"This is just awesome.There are so many things we can do with this device and that made me wonder that why this is so cheap.I got a smart bulb with the device in just 2500 rs.Now I control my bluetooth speaker, my tv(firestick) and my bedroom light with my voice commands.This is fun for my 4 years old kid too and Alexa tell stories to him.The voice recognition is very good and the proof is that even my kid's commands Alexa recognise."
104,"Voice is not recognising what ever we say something like play songs from ABC movies or storieseven we restart device multiple times, could you please help on thisVoice is not recognise and Even I changed default music to amazon music app when I ask Alexa play music from amazon music it's not recognizing tried multiple times its not working can help meWorst software desinged sont blame customers just providing like switch off lightsand ola bokking..etc because whatever we spoken alexa is not listen even it contains builtin jio songs. Lets say examples alexa play  palasa 1978 movie telugu songs..but default its going default liat songs are playing from jio saavan insyead of what i given command... And even we created playlist from differeny music apps(jio saavan,spotify) but its not recognizing. with Ads you are providing whoever developed does they using this? They know the faults...rigorously test software...Please improve this more and more feature"
105,"A great device to have, makes your life easier, combined with other smart devices it makes your home a smart home,Coming to the product,Build quality is very good, looks great, anti slip base keeps it in place, sound is also crisp clear, sufficient base and enough volume,Connectivity is also good,Cons:- needs constant power supply, would have been better if it had battery backupSuggestion to amazon:If it could be used as bluetooth speaker"

107,"Best home usable device for entertainment.. If you are thinking to buy it or not, then I'm sure that you will get thrill and enjoy after buying it. I was also thinking same but then I bought it for Rs.3000 during discount period. So, wait and buy it when it goes to price of Rs.3000 or below.Currently, it is Rs. 3500 but wait and I""'m sure that it will go down to Rs.3000 within a 1 or 1.5 month. Just wait and check regularly the price of this product (check daily atleast once).If you thinking to buy google home mini, then don't buy at all, I've experienced both. Echo dot is thousand times better that it. Google home mini don't recogine your voice well and can't perform e-commercial and play games activities."
108,"Not happy,It's work with limited 2or 3 app.It's not work with you tube and other search engine.Many songs are doesn't understand it.Overall not good experience"
109,"I was thinking of buying this echo dot for a very long tym! & one day i got a 1000 rs cashback in my amazon pay balance (reason is still i dont know)üòπSo i brought this echo dot for a net amt of 1499/- & it was a super cool offerConnectivity was suprr quick & i connected all my bedroom appliances with alexaRoutines setup was super fun ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èshe plays my fav soundtracks , she sings for me , say hi to my friends , sets alarm for me , and there is a lot lot things that she doesPacking was super  & delvry boy was very coolI am enjoying alexa's company very well & thankyou amazon for d product"
110,Pros1. It explains Vocabulary2. for English and Hindi Songs ( that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music ) Cons1. It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.
111,"Interaction with Alexa quaility is very W roust...Alexa software is very bad..No Use ..compared to Google Voice.Compared to Phone Google Voice is better response and good result.Alexa not matured, No knowledge upgraded compared to google voice.Alexa Device is No Use compared to google voice in Phone.Mico is not good quality.Different answers for simple questions from Alexa.Alexa replay is not good.This device not good for playing for few days.. Fully boring with alexa replay.Waste of Money.We have to wait for New latest generation software for alexa until its waste of product."
112,Echo Dot 3rd gen is an absolutely amazing device. It works as expected and has great amount of features. Th sound signature is good and Alexa works 100pc of the time. Although there is room for improvement in voice recognition when there is too much noise in the room or fan is running and search results of Alexa also needs some improvements. Overall a great product at good price
113,Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English.7. Now Amit ji voice on alexa but Alexa sweet enough to entertain you.
114,"You can buy it with no hesitation. But my suggestion is the people who are looking to or having a SMART HOME like everything in your house is automated with Voice command it's good for you. And for the normal houses it's just act like a Bluetooth Speaker that's it somewhere around in a corner laying in your house. If you want to BUY it first convert your house like smart bulbs, tubelights, android TV, remote enabled fans, Ac's. Normal houses just a speaker that you can talk when bored for entertainment."
115,"Eco dot 3rd gen . Some time not recognise conamds and skills.. company claim fully smart speaker. But when you use eco dot 3rd gen you realise .. is this not a fully smart speaker.. hardware is good but software is not up to the mark .. need more updates.. link with maps ... Some time then i ask ""where is Mathura"" answere correct...but when i say ""how i go Mathura"" no route find by alexa eco dot 3rd gen.... More updates needed....may be...üòä"
116,Sound - The clarity is fantastic. It does provide a surround sound feel. The bass is great until volume 7 after which it starts jarring. Please don't expect it to fulfill a theatre or disc like experience!Voice recognition - pretty much spot on everytime!!Only drawback is no bluetooth option for aux capabilities!!
117,"i purchased the alexe echo dot device for my grand daughter 3 days bach. i was unable to set up the device .i and my son struggled for several hours for 2 days. then we called customer support. while they talk very sweetly they do not keep their promises . no mail is received . no return phone call as promised. we have to continousy follow up leavng all our other work. after paying 4000rupees this is a big punishment. the device cannot connect to the wi-fi. the customr support came to the conclusion that the device is DEFECTIVE , and will be replaced . i do not know when . i am keeping folded hands praying. THIS IS THE FATE OF ON LINE SHOPPING WITH AMAZON"
118,"I would like to take some time while explaining my experiences with Alexa.Initially, I was very skeptiCal about these devices, and I was manuovered by the feelings that these devices are just a marketing propaganda and there is no practical use of it. Adding to the woes is the electronic items from Amazon which is not a specialist in such items also magnified my negative images for such devices.My eleder brother ordered this device for his use and the lockdown offered me some time to spend with my family including Alexa device.  I am writing the review after regular two week use of the devices and my feedback is followingPros-Timely delivery by Amazon.Great packing.Easy to setup the device.Amazing sound quality, I was amazed to see that a pocket fitting devices can produce such loud and clear output.Very prompt reply from the device upon any request.Multi language support.Works very fluently with the mobile hotspot.Smart home integration is awesome.ConsAlexa gets upset sometimes as housewife's do. You just need to set it again.Final verdict- just go for it. It's a super device."
119,"Sound quality is good but not the best (you cannot expect more according to the price range)Sound quality : 7.5/10Responsive : 8/10, could have been better but it does the jobMusic : very less features when it comes to music many little things that's possible through phone is not available.Overall : 6/10.You can go for it, its not a necessity as most of the things is achievable through smartphone easily than this."
120,"Overall product is ok. But I'm not happy with the price and Alexa integration. She can recognize your voice from approx 10m of a distance. However, the recommendations/ suggestions provided by Alexa is not satisfactory. I mostly listen to music and the choices she makes are inexact. I mean idk how she come up with lame songs. For example, i have asked for Hollywood songs, she sometimes starts playing bhojpuri songs üòïüòï, additionally i have asked her to repeat what i have asked and she replies the correct sentence, and that's more strange.Anyways, price comparing to product, price is too high i bought it for 2500 and i would be happy to buy it for approx 1500. But, more than 2000 is unacceptable for Alexa.Trust me, I regret buying this product. Also, it's not even wireless üôÑüôÑüôÑ. It's app is too heavy which makes it too slow and so on.If you earn Luke crazy money, go for it... It's good for show off. However, if you are that person who thinks before buying, DON'T. BUY. IT. Pls, save your money for better things."
121,"The most frustrating feature of Alexa is the annoying announcement while connecting to Bluetooth. it does every time when it connects with the device and there is no way to disable it. People have been crying for years, while Amazon is not listening.Other than that it is much better in comparison to google home mini. In comparison voice quality and search too."
122,"This is my second purchase, the first one was bought in Noida. It was great. But this one, I got it delivered in Imphal, Manipur. The bass of the speaker is distorted, the sound is distorted. It is nowhere as good as the one I got it in Noida. Is Amazon trying to sell defected products in the north-east or something? It takes longer than usual to reach Imphal even tho I have a prime membership, on top of that, you're selling us defected products. Shameful. Now I'll have to wait for 10-15 days for it to get replaced. With the lockdown and all, who knows how longer it'll take. Extremely disappointed."
123,"A must have product in your room. It does understand English and Hindi questions and queries better than 'Google Home' and also the sound quality is excellent when compared. Bluetooth feature comes very handy and notification light-blinking is also a great way. Better build quality than the previous generations. Featured skills are also available on the Alexa app including the Alexa-calling and broadcasting features. Mic is also very responsive too. Bass of the speaker is sufficient for a medium-sized room. Only issue is that with the manual buttons on the top which ""for my taste"" looks very ugly. Although if looks are not the priority then it is THE BEST buy in the smart-speaker segment today."
124,It's versatile in the sense that everyone at home can play almost whatever they like. But most songs available on Amazon music are not recognized by voice commands. You need to search them on phone and then cast on the speaker. Also I think a wall mount should be included in the package.
125,"I had purchased the product on 27/10/2019. It was working well and fine for 6 months. After 6 months all of sudden it stopped working. Got issues with connecting to wifi, integration issues.Requested for a replacement which never happened for 3 months. When I reviewed the product with this fact, I got call from executives promising refund and I returned the product. But it's 3 weeks now, I neither have the product nor the refund. Go for it only to waste yur beloved hard earned money.!!Edit: Finally, after one year and multiple complaints, the amount was refunded completely in October 2020. Afterall, I still feel Amazon is best."

127,"#1) Alexa doesn't have full feature:  1.1) struggles to have the reminder or reminder doesn't works at all.  1.2) doesn't remember the play list  1.3) doesn't store multiple play list or facing problem to retrieve multiple playlist.  1.4) cldn't find the multi-language recognition feature/skill (eg: Tamil)#2) As usual issue with pay-on-delivery :  Courier shows resistance on Pay on delivery by cash.  Otherwise, everything is perfect by quality and delivery."
128,"I've been using it for 2 months now, working totally fine. Voice quality and volume is really great comparing with its size. Voice recognition is good. Doesn't work without wifi. Best for home use, bluetooth connectivity is seemless. If you love to listen music and use AI to schedule meetings, alarms, listen to news, this one is for you. It doesn't have a battery, runs only on electricity. In this price range, this is the best product"
129,"I have purchased this for my kids class, but it always drops the voice in between and speaker is not compatible with zoom. We expect at least voice in the zoom call should be fine, but it isn't. it is not the internet or bandwidth problem, because I have 100Mbps and 5G WiFi connectivity. If you are going for meetings I would recommend to go with another product."
130,"A bit suprised by how lpud the speaker is, voice recognition is good with the fan on at full speed.Tried using an RCA to Aux to connect this to an old Sony BluRay. This allowed me to play songs from my phone on the old Sony, but frankly the audio could be way louder and clearer.The Wipro smart bulb works without issues."
131,"I had Google donut but it failed miserably, Echo dot is much better ...however it doesnt recognize some questions. But nevertheless good device. But the smart bulb I got with it is very very tough to adjust with it through app, still havent been able to do it as the bulb instructions arent veryclear"
132,Worst ever delivery experiance from amazon..your otp based delivery is the worst thing. Getting frustrated by waiting for otp after delivery...especially at times of mobile network failures...no msg came for otp.... no option to re send the otp.. no instant customer care number to contact... user enemy application... if your algorithm fails to satisfy our customer needs give us an alternate to reach your customer care....  here after i wont use amazon for purchasing any thing..... give us alernative if your algorithm fails...  dont make us fools  by your algorithm  rules... one star for makes us frustrated by your delivery rules..
133,"It's quite a simple, yet powerful device. While the voice recognition system still needs to improve. The range of microphones is wide and it wakes up on calling, instantly, most of the time. The speaker quality is good and pairing two of the for a stereo configuration will make it much better. Alexa works well as advertised and with additional skills, it can become better. Would love to see more regional language officially supported as it's right now restricted to Hindi only."
134,"I was very confused between google nest & Eco dot because my Tv is Android,but I choose Alexa and I found ,sound quality is far better than google.But I think google has its own qualities which Alexa cannot reach.Now I think I cannot live without Alexa."
135,"Amazon products are worst in terms of software. This one doesn't understand your words most of the times. Even if it does, it will play any random music, instead of the one you asked for."
136,"Pros1. Sound Quality Superb,2. device looks great stylish.3. Alexa is too good only in those things which are shown in TV ad. Dim the light, play animal sound, so on. But world does not end here.Cons1. Integration with other device poor and take lot of time. Software and app working is poor.2. Voice recognition - Extremely poor especially when volume is above 5. Sometime I have scream, You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya. üòÄ3. Music - When you say play 90s songs, it starts with same set and sequence of songs. Boring.4. Every time we have keep for charging.5. After Wipro smart bulb price deduction, effectively Alexa cost me 1700/-, but won't feel worth. As a speaker only yes it is.At last Good affords by Amazon but long way to go."
137,"Alexa is good for bollywood and hollywood songs when it comes to tollywood and other regions languages such as telugu, tamil Alexa is not responding properly. Infact it's unable to recognize telugu music(Albams). It's needs to improve more in recognizing regional languages."
138,"I am not criticizing this product but I hope it helps to improve the quality in future.The speaker quality is very good I will give 6 star out of 5 stars..but the question understanding ability is very very very worst.. if any question asked it gives irrelevant answers..It answers only for simple qustions like what's time, what's my name like that ü§¶If I want to play desired songs in local language I has to tell alexa for atleast 5 to 10 times to understand to get exact song ü§¶ü§¶But I am not returning this product back because I like the audio output sound very much."
139,"I purchased Amazon Alexa 3rd Generation in November 2020. Since, April 2021 whenever I connect my phone through Bluetooth and play something on it through my phone, the sound that comes from it is distorted.And then I asked for help from amazon. They told me to purchase the same new device since it's a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.I recommend not to buy this device."
140,"Excellent device! After Fire TV Stick this is my 2nd Amazon made smart device & it once again surprises me. Sound quality is good enough. Voice recognition also works great. Only drawback is there is no Spotify integration, So I have to depend on Amazon Music/Jiosaavan which are both crap. Except that it's a great smart little device through which you can elaborate your smart life quite amazingly."
141,"I have both Google Home and Alexa.Alexa works better with smart devices. It responds much quicker to requests on turning light on/off compared to GHome, which clearly lags.However, Alexa lags GHome on answering questions and playing music. When asked to play music, it frequently responds with ""Saavn is not available in your region"" while playing Saavn other times. Also it's response to natural language questions is behind GHome.Speaker quality great. Speaker sensitivity excellent-it catches the wake word even when spoken from a distance. GHome lags here."
142,Like.Product is good. Integration with Amazon music is good.DislikeNo battery back up. So it occupies the power point. Not portable as well. Major disadvantage for the price paid. The same size of branded wireless speakers are far cheaper.
143,Alexa doesn't understand the commands properly.I ask to Play Sainyoo Nee it Plays Sainya Ve.I ask to Play. It plays some other languages radio station which we don't understand.It is not able to recognise the Wipro Bulb.I am fed up with Alexa. I want to return it back. If Possible.
144,"I didn't like the sound signature, I had to reduce the Bass to 0 and mid and treble to 10 to make it suit my ears. The Alexa app is very sluggish. It's very well built, can recognise voice from distance, options are less as compared to google assistant."
145,"Best Smart Speaker I have bought , Got it a very good price during Amazon Great Indian Festival, got it for around Rs 2200 along with Smart Led Buld.Pros :1. Very Good build quality.2. Superb Design3. Amazing Audio Quality4. Very good audio songs collection.5. Helps is various smart task like controlling smart lights at home.Cons :1. Not portable like a Bluetooth speaker as it requires power and internet.Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I can recommend this if you are someone looking for a smart speaker with good sound quality."

¬†Most of the time dont understand what song you are requesting...most popular songs cant be played...which is very annoying. But good for alexa devices"
147,"Its one of the finest smart speaker in indian market nd amazon prime 999rs per year subscription gives more benefits with music, video,etc When it comes to hardware it hav good sound which fills one smal room. Echo support more smart accessories thn google home nd apple homepod thats big thumbs up for Echoüëçüèº When it comes to software its lacks so much features. Google home ll give you more accurate answers and follw up conservation. Alexa properly dnt deals with follow up multiple questions. Amazon music dnt have more collections lik spotify, wynk. So overall good hardware with poor software. Needs to improve more in software. You need to plug in al the time because it does not come with battery option."
148,"Well, good for kids but for the most part AI needs huge amount of work, dont expect smartness like google, it more of bluetooth speaker and there are better options available in this price range. My daughter likes to play around with Alexa with all kinds of unusual questions. Decided to keep it"
149,"Product is good, after using for a month, felt bad, I should have gone to 4th generation, few features are missing in it, just a suggestion should have added micro sd features too, to listen for some downloaded songs also. All features are good and working well, HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT."
150,I bought it 2 days backI turn off charging during night when I plug again in morning it is taking time to connect and after some time it stops responding to commands and also it won't work with button also then I have to restart 2 times minimum
151,"All is good with this device, don't understand how tough it would have been to integrate a battery into it. Worse, the power adapter is not industry standard Micro-USB or Type C. Amazon's way of making people dependent on their proprietary power adapter, and eliminating chance of powering it with a power bank"
152,"Please note you will enjoy this device only when you will be prime member of Amazon (1000 k/year).Otherwise it's very bad after few days. Initially you will enjoy voice command, but it's not accurate and limited. So you will want to control it from mobile. But it's only possible to prime members."
153,"After one year of useless use: They are just making customer fool by selling a box useful with only Amazon Prime .. U cannot use hotatar, Sony liv, ganna, wynk .. Nothing as no app/skill supported .. I am regretting to buy such cheap, useless dumb box .. And with Alexa, u will have headache as she don't know anything.. Best is Google by miles"
154,"This is a fully honest review...............Ok, Echo Dot Is a great smart speaker with great abilitiesprosIt can control almost every smart home deviceSpeaker Quality is greathave hundreds of skillsspeaks Hindi as wellcan buy products from amazonMic is really awesome, can hear you from another roomA really good feature, you can talk to her in Hindi and English at the same time! like, you gave a command in English and you can give the next command in Hindi!her voice is better than google assistantcoordinates wellGood for children as wellcan control other Alexa devices as wellConssome times she does not wake up, after saying the wake-up word 2 or 3 times then she wake upI don't know why they removed the Zomato skill, it was a good skillsometimes she listens wrongStarsAlexa-4Speaker-5Coordination-5Mic-5Build Quality-3.5skills-4.5smart home control-5waking up-3understanding-4Overall review--A great smart speaker but I will suggest buying an Echo instead of Echo DotThat's all Folks!"
155,"Feature wise review.1. Sound quality - 5 star (loud and clear).2. Voice recognition - 43. Alexa Intergration - 34. Smart features - 3.55. Alexa Skills - 2.5There is a lot of improvement neede in terms of Alexa skills as it doesn't work well in most of the scenario such as Alexa is not able to give you search results based on your exact location. In one scenario, I was searching for Dominos to check its efficiency, It gave me the nearest result which was not even in my city, even though my wifi, gps was ON and the location was well marked on google maps as well."
156,"Sound/audio quality is much better than other competitors but when it comes to AI, very poor AI, looks like it's not learning over the time, it just follow simple command which graduate guy can implement. If it's only for speaker then go for some other good brands. Very poor integration with mobile app, fire stick. Didn't find any module to understand it. Very important for my family which is do not support Marathi regional language and do not interpret marathi sonngs very clearly, neither Marathi names."
157,"Bold, soothing voice of alexa and spatial sound of the speaker stabilize you in your home. Movie, music sounds great on this. Durable quality and the texture surround on it. I spent most of my time with it while i am home. Also i got both the product at a remarkable deal. I much more contented with these products from amazon. Wipro led bulb works well with alexa. Thank you amazon!"
158,"Its not good as i thought about it.Even its not working according to my expectations.Whenever i ask or ordered somethingAlexa didn't perform its 100% even its doesn't know some common locations or alexa doesn't know about very common songs singer n album's its totally worthless in this task nd this is the biggest issues i faced with alexa and the last thing is alexa doesn't satisfied my expectations üòëüòêSo its totally up to you guys either you improved its skills or take my suggestion,queries nd issues lightlyIt depends on you guys,you take this note as my humble request or a joke but seriously its not a joke üòáüòáI am Your one of the well wisher not a judge üòä"
159,"Ya i like it's very much but my point of view is it's bit expensive to buy it for those planning to listen music it serves best with talking to alexa and AI stuff but when you listen music or just watch movie in laptop connected to it's not upto the mark you will get disappointed but for AI it's good ,may be its next gen have enough bass and sound for songs but definitely not this one , this one has more crisp voice which is very good while talking with alexa."
160,I bought echo dot 3rd gen and was so happy with it that I bought echo input s week after. The ease of using without the phone or laptop is great. The sound is good enough. Obviously it cannot compare with big standalone speaker. I have connected the dot to my big speakers and using input in any room I want because it is portable
161,"After every power outage, Alexa fails to connect to my router. I understand That My router takes a bit to start up. But Alexa doesn't do anything and not even try to reconnect. I had to unplug and plug Alexa after every power outage  and this is really frustrating and really not very ideal thing for me. It would have been better if Alexa would try to reconnect automatically to my wifi or if there was a way to restart alexa through app."
162,"Hi guys if u have Wi-Fi in your house only than... Buy it or else.... U need to use your phones hotspot and connect .... And one.... More thing is u need to plug it everytime u can't take it and roam lik other Bluetooth... Speaker's..... These are cons of this, I hope Amazon bring solution for.... This.. ,,, rest everything is fine..."
163,"Have issues of unresponsive behaviour rarely  and needs a restart for immediate use or had to wait few minutes, mine works 24*7 so may be that's an issue? This is my second Echo and it's worth using at home if you have smart switches installed."
164,I was using google all along. Bought alexa for a variant. 3rd gen is good. Bass and treble are very nice in that product range. Overall loved the product. Got the product after one week of struggle and follow up with amazon. A very bitter experience in the last 8 years of mydealing with Amazon.
165,The product is solid and always require electricity to run.Upon initiating it doesn't make any sound like it8is working mode now.Always hear after 2 to 3 calls of alexa very poor voice recognition.Sound quality is good
166,Superb product. Easy to setup and so convenient to use. I've set it up to link to my Spotify account so you get even a larger database if music with Prime music and Spotify combined.The sound quality surprised me. I have many other portable speakers but this one is one of the better ones.GO FOR IT.
167,I bought this in offer in 2290. I liked the product as the speaker quality is good for a bedroom size. The voice recognition is good. Overall the Alexa works fine but of course there are flaws in understanding of instructions by Alexa because artificial intelligence is still just the tip of the iceberg. I don't think it would have been a good buy if bought above this price.
168,"Works great! Though it doesn't make anything significantly easier, it's a nice addition to ones room and also a good starting point to experience the future.Audible Suno is a superb bonus to this product. And also most used music services like gaana and jio saavn are free to use, which makes this very useful. Last bust not the least, it can easily revive the dying interest in you about the radio channels.But also be aware that you are signing up for some sort of compromise in your data privacy!"
169,We have been using Echo dot for playing Music with Kids around. It becomes easier to play songs without have to look out for the Phone. So less screen time in front of Kids and more family time.Speaker volume is good for hall. Good for in-house get-together.
170,I have been using it for almost 5 months and till now I don't have any problem with it.It recognises most of the commands give to it. It surfs information from Google to give accurate answers.I liked that it's speakers are very loud and clear sound quality.Works excellent for both Hindi and English commands.Not much difference between echo dot 3rd generation and 4th generation.
171,"I bought it in 2019 during Amazon festival offer, worth for the money.I have set the alarm in morning to play suprabatha and devotional songs, so I wake up hearing that.I use it to control my Wipro WiFi light and batten. I can even ask it to switch specific channel on my Airtel Xtrem set up box.Excellent device."
172,"The product is really good, dont judge the sound quality by its size, its heavily boosted bass makes us go crazy for the song, voice recognition is great even during noisy conditions one thing that it lacks is the portability it needs a power source connected to a socket all the time but for this price point there are real good Bluetooth speakers hence if Amazon could come up with wireless echo speaker it would be really good, I also bought the wipro bulb with the combo ajd integrated it with echo dot and it it awesome. You can change brightness colour preset modes jist with your voice but it requires the bulb and echo dot to be connected to the same network all the time"
173,"Impressive:1. Easy command recognition from a child of three years old.2. Good interpretation of the command, per se.Expectations:1. Acceptance of English and Hindi command simultaneously.2. Offering choices of singers when a particular song is sung by many artists. At present, it always starts with the same artist.3. Offering choices of different starting points and sequences. E.g. for a command of ""Bhajan"" or ""instrumental lullabies"" it starts with the same song/music and proceeds with the same sequence. Soon it becomes monotonous. This needs improvement4. Identifying voices of the members of the family and offering their types of music. With its excellent ability of identifying voice it seems to be easy to recognize and remember voice by names of the family members (and the rest by guest). Remembering choices of the family members and offering music accordingly would be expected. Obviously, a reset option is must in such cases."
174,Not mentioned in the description that it does not run on battery. So won't work when travelling unless connected to a plug point. It only runs on the power adapter. Returning it.
175,"It is very good but not searching like Google, maximum time reply that I don't know....limited news & radio station.. More improvement required. If you want to know about some one, alexa reply ""don't know"" but Google always tell about that."
176,"Nice one I am enjoying but the voice recognition still required to be improved by Amazon as some time it recognises u but and some time it doesn't. But some where I felt still Alexa required to improve than Google Assistance, as Google is much faster and much informative then Alexa, as many times it says sorry I don't know this."
177,"So many surprises after owning Alexa Eco dot.Too many bugs to recognize voice. Oftentimes does not understand the command and keep playing existing. Doesnt work reset command. Doesnt understand request from choice of songs to paly. Like if i wish to play specific album from Gana or Amazon music, it stick to play from Jio Savan and that is my horrible experience from Eco dot.Amazon team, pls fix such bugs and update else the customer reviews wont let you up."
178,"Eco dot 3rd generation is amazing device, somtimes beyond my imagination ... Alexa is complete package of entertainment - it has Radio channels like vividh bharti, fm gold,fm rainbow etc. and unlimited old and latest songs @amazon music and other sources like hungama music, jokes and much more .... It can read my Kindle books as audio book...Eco dot also has powerful speaker so it's rocking device. Thanks Amazon for Alexa. Recommended!üëçüëçüëçüëç"
179,"The sound quality is very good as compared to previous generation . But Alexa assistants skills and integration with other smart devices(bluetooth) including Fire TV is very choppy.Alexa response is incorrect at times even after multiple repeats. It's wifi reception is not good, cannot work in weak  internet reception , Google home mini performs pretty well on these parameters."
180,Just the uniqueness of the speaker and the ease of getting information and hearing songs.This is a must buy among all amazon products. Dont think twice just get it its awesome. Prerequisite is good wifi connection at home. Please note this speaker has to be connected to a powersource and the power block and cable is included n the box. Also amazon prime membership is a must. As I do have the above its everything I can ask for.
181,Very very poor recognition. Even if i stay 1/2 meter away it's not recognising my voice. Sound quality is very good. Sometimes there is an issue of pairing even if i have speed network.After few weeks of usage I see that when i try connecting device with my mobile and use Bluetooth to play songz its breaking completely and vould not hear song properly. nit sure why i purchased this stupid amazon echo better i would have purchased google mini.
182,When we cast amazon music with exhi it recognises only straight forward songs. No podcast or stations are played in echo. And it even does not recognise podcast through voice. The alexa app is also too slow  Better to go for google
183,Need to integrate with Kannada FM channels and news channels. It‚Äôs playing only ajtak news headlines.We don‚Äôt have option to change name of Alexa .If they add new feature it‚Äôs plus point for them.Apart from this for me it‚Äôs worth to buy below 2.5k.
184,"When I first brought this product I loved this but after 2 months of use I had to reset it as it could not connect to internet and to set-up for 2nd time it took me 2 hours as really could not connect to internet.The main problem for this device is, if there is no internet then its a dumb box, could not do anything. This is nowhere mentioned in the product description. Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need. This is irritating most of the times and then I switch to mobile app to play the right song, so having alexa and having a normal bluetooth speaker for me is same, no value addition. Hoping Amazon will improve its AI features a lot like google or Siri."
185,"It needs a lot of improvements, we can not play songs directly from mobile to the echo dot, we can not browse songs through the apps( Gaana, saavn, prime music) and it only accepts voice commands for playing music. It would be better if we can type the song to be played as it doesn't recognize a lot of songs through voice commands. Needs high speed Internet to function properly. It does not recognize voice commands when a song is playing, so we can't mute it while a song is playing. Despite all these cons, it is still a pretty handy product."
186,"Alexa needs some real upgrade in general. As for the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, VERY POOR Voice Recognition. I literally have to yell for Alexa to listen. Be it cranking the volume, changing tracks, or anything whatsoever. Had quite some expectations since I proudly own a fire stick. Even after buying the speaker (which I bought mainly for the purpose so that all my favorite music could come in handy), I still prefer to play music on my TV than on my speaker. I mean why buy a speaker if you can't even play music on it without a fuss. Overall, it's a big NO. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED."
187,"Honestly not that great, not into the whole voice recording thing, would love to return it however the window is over.... The volume as an external speaker is not that great and it has to be plugged in to work"
188,Look it's good but there are still many questions which echo cannot answer something which Google home does very easily but overall it's good.  I can be improved if echo's software is updated.there is one more problem that it sometimes it does not catch your voice while it is answering your question so you will have to press the button at that time to stop echo from answering. But one thing I would like to say that its speaker is  really good one.
189,"Alexa is great. For a bedroom or a living room, Alexa works like magic. I also got a light (Wifi enabled) from wipro along with Alexa as a package and it had works wonder for us.It understands Hindi, English and also talks with us when we are alone or lonely.You can also connect Alexa with your mobile using it as a Bluetooth speaker. It's a true fact that this version has to be plugged in all the time- but apart from this- its just GREAT! I loved it and a true fan of ALEXA!"
190,"Extremely bad experience with Amazon- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it."
191,"Actually ,earlier it did not recognise my voice and I thought it is a device manufacturing issue but one thing I realised is that Amazon is far far better then any e- commerce company currently present in India. I mean I had put a bad review considering the unknowning fact about its language change in the device which I was not aware. I got a call from  Ireland call centre asking me about the issue and trust me guys I am really IMPRESSED by the way, Amazon customer service representatives handled the issue. So, to all who face an issue with regards to voice recognition in the particular device can request for help through customer care and you will be amazed with the help and later usage.From now I am a Amazon user, Bye Bye Flipkart-!!"
192,when I setup echo dot after 2 hours it told sorry I have trouble understanding right now please try a little later i tried after 2 hours  it was not fixed  and then I replaced the item and again after 2 hours then  told the same thing and again I waited but it was not fixed then i baught google nest mini it was working
193,This device will stop working after the warranty expires. This is one of the most pathetic experience I‚Äôve ever had with a tech device. Wasn‚Äôt expected out of amazon!
194,"I like Alexa feature of Echo Dot. I extremely enjoy the color changing LED light and other features of Alexa. I would have given it 5 star but I sometimes face small issue when Alexa doesn't respond instantaneously. After 2-3 attempts, Alexa responds so that's a mood killer at times else its super amazing and fun."
195,"The device is completely dumb if internet connectivity is bad.It could have a memory where some of the information could be kept like storing song, story etc to play later.It should play a shorter command to signify disconectivity.Not a full length message' I am hha"
196,This product is awesome. It recognizes what song you want to hear and plays it immediately from its vast library. Voice recognition is great. It can hear u from a distance even when songs are playing. I am loving it.
197,"I bought This Product for my parents. My parents have very interest in listening songs at morning time and this product is very important for them. My parents loved this product so much. Sometimes it happens that we want to Listen songs but we think which song i should play. Instead of this, in this AI SPEAKER you have to just say ur favourite singers name and speaker will play songs of that singers. Easy to use."
198,Well it was an offer with 12 watt smart bulb. Offer said pay 200 rs more and get 12 watt bulb. Unfortunately did not say anywhere that the price if alexa will be reduced abd bulb would cost me 700 rs.That was misleading. I could have saved the money. Sorry but feel like cheated.
199,"hi Team ,i  recently observed that the alexa is only listing when i am speaking loudly .  I found this issue when i used the other alexa device at my friend home . Please look into this as alexa is not listing when i am specking at normal pitch .My contact no :- 9654542266"
200,"Has been using since 9 months..The sound quality is excellent ,It's surprising to see a small sized device like this to have great bass and treble.It can produce sound 360¬∞.this kind of sound quality is seen in top companies like JBL, Bose..Axela as a voice assistant is really useful especially helping in your daily needs like a remainders , timers or even for some quick information.using the Alexa app you can make it more personalised..As an voice assistant it has got some cons when compared to google assistantGoogle is a web browser so it definitely has more information when compared to AlexaIt can be used as a Bluetooth speaker which is really nice as it can play music even from 15-20 m awaySome cons-It's voice recognition capability has reduced after 6 months but if you speak enough loud it will identifyIt must be always connected to a power supply , sometimes it becomes difficult to place it properly also it must be connected to wifi at anytimeThe Alexa calling is really worst but the message feature is quite usefulThese cons actually do not matter a lotConclusion:Definitely prefer it buying it for yourself or as a gift .if you have a prime account you will also get Amazon music which is quite usefulPricing: I've got it in a sale for around 2.5k with an Wipro wifi smart bulb freeAfter 9 months expect a good deal for 3-4kAnd also don't forget to buy an aux cable if you want to connect it to some better speakers"
201,"Not user friendly, Frequently loose WiFi connection and Need long procedure and multiple steps to connect again.Secondly, I have raised complaints and ask for replacement. Amazon has registered complain and inform that pickup will be done within two days but nobody came and after two week removed my replacement request as well on Amazon site. It is my very bad experience with this product and amazon. I request Amazon should stop this product if unable to provide services."
202,"I have been using Alexa Echo Dot from last one week.My house has a very good wifi connection but Alexa always has trouble connecting to the Internet.It understands what I say but never play songs. Most of the time, it does not understand clear English words as well.Alexa app shows the song, but Alexa does not understand the same keywords to play a song.Overall, I would not suggest the product at all. Do not waste your money on such useless product that most of time won't play music for you for which it is purchased."
203,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Product is good but have some problem to recognize the instructions and not able to play the desired songs."
204,I bought  eco 3rd generation for just  rupees  2499 on 15days bk. I returned  product  after  too days it's working  sometimes only always  we need to go for reset  mode and connect it. I don't  understand  such a non compatible  product why amazon incresing  price day by day. It's a local China  product  .they need to increase quality
205,"Worth the money. Could work better on voice recognition. Otherwise pretty decent.Sound quality is better than what I had expected.Overall, Alexa is a better option than Google home."
206,"One has to keep it on for 24hrs. I know why you want to keep, because every time you are feeding alexa with the data. Remember folks, it can also be spy, which is recording your voice.If it get off, u have to again resetup, which is quite tedious and boredom approach.It should be wireless."
207,I bought first Alexa 3500 work preety well but after few days I saw same item in amazon from same seller cloud tail in 2399 why there is big price difference. That mean this product doesn't value 3500So stop fooling customer.
208,"It is unstable machine, even if you configure it to give same results, it stop providing the same routine .Cheap R&D...Better go with other IOT options"
209,"She's family member now. Great way to keep kids talking to her and yet away from sceen. being working parents we don't get much time to keep talking to kids, but now they have someone to answer all the time. I now  never forget taking calcium after setting reminder. Worth buying"
210,Not even  60% fit for south Indians even  after adding tamil skills..most of the tamil or telegu songs it is unable to understand. Best options for training kids with english rhymes or songs.
211,"This is must buy product for those who loves music , has a busy schedule and live alone. I think ur heart don't need anyone if alexa is present with u.It's useful for every age groups. It understands hindi language very accurately nd this is the most lovable thing about alexa. It has a lot of qualities butI'm mentioning only cons depending upon situations:U need a broadband connection or any wifi device to fully utilize the features because it listen to u only when internet worksNd the second thing is 24hour power supply because there is no battery inside it.That's the only reason I returned it.Go for it n I'm sure you'll love itüòäüòç"
212,"Bought it during Diwali Sale for Rs. 2449/- and Wipro Smart Bulb for Rs. 99/-... And to be honest, it is an amazing device which makes ur life easy!!!Though ""Google Home"" gives satisfactory answers than ""Echo Dot"" for the questions  which are asked, but the Sound Quality that ""Echo Dot"" offers is just AMAZING...If u are confused about which one to buy, i.e, ""Google Home Mini"" or ""Echo Dot"", then I would suggest for Echo dot because of its overall performance...And coming to the Smart Bulb, I would say that, it is kinda a good product which u can get at a low price..."
213,HiI don't know where to start. Since day 1 there is issue in configuring wifi. The steps not helping. Alexa support is horrible. Seems they don't care. I don't know what to do with this alexa. Use as a 2300 INR speaker ?
214,"Only question it answered was what's the weather today?"" that was after setup.for every question it keeps saying ""sorry, I am having trouble understanding right now. Please try a little later.""It has been 10 days. I have changed rooms, distance from wall, furniture, questions, tone, every thing.Nothing works!"
215,"Awesome product.Interaction: 5/5Sound quality: 5/5Size:5/5It‚Äôs great it works like Bluetooth speaker when wifi not available, but it‚Äôs not. :( this made some disappointment.But overall impressive product."
216,Not at all worthy. Wastage of money. Performance is not good. And Amazon is not cooperating for return. I got the exchange product today but as usual the set up button is so uncomfortable and its painful to press it for a longer time. And the sound quality is so pathetic that music doesn't seems to melodies. It feels like a non branded local speaker. As usual the wrist product from Amazon. Really unexpected from a Amazon. Very disappointing and Amazon team is not even ready to give my money back.
217,"Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is the best in terms of hardware. Amazing sound quality with proper balance between base, mids and treble. And yes you can configure too in the Alexa app if you‚Äôd like.Next, is the build quality. It is really good and feels firm. Bluetooth and wi-fi connectivity is awesome. Best part is I can connect it to my phone & laptop and use it as an external speaker.The only downside for me is Alexa. She needs a lot of improvement in terms of knowledge. Basic things are carried out pretty well like reminders, alarms, music, etc. however, when it comes to answering questions she fails most of the time.Tip: Keep adding skills in the Alexa app for improvement."
218,Waste product as it doesn't come with a baterry so it needs always a plug point to be connected. Basically it can be used only in home and not outdoor. In today's portable live this is a waste of purchase and doesn't solve any purpose without portability
219,"The Alexa voice assistant will never understand the commands you say. Don‚Äôt ever buy this the only reason it is promoted here is because of Amazon. I have a Google home as well, and looking at how well it performs at the same tasks. This here is Jeff Bezos turd. My review is applicable for all Alexa devices."
220,"Amazon Echo 3rd Gen is really a good personal assistant and it's price worth.It's features1. Easy to connect from your android phone.2. Easy to play songs, listen news, Headlines, weekly news, sports news and many more.3. Able to answer basics questions easily but sometimes it's not able to search on Google and it will then reply by saying "" o don't know that.4. Good sound quality ( really good Bass )5. At the price of 2000 INR.  It's a good speaker as comparison to others. So don't wait more thinking to buy or not. Just order it and enjoy the Amazon Alexa.6. One thing should be needed is that it's connectivity from Google or any other sear h engine. So that it can search over that and can find easly the answer of any question ask by the user.7. And also need to improve some security features over securing users data and some sound detection mechanism.8. Overall it's a good speaker along with a good personal assistant."
221,"Happy customer. Sound quality and voice command is amazingly good. But one thing you must ensure that if you need best experience, better opt for Amazon Prime subscription first. Coz it will sure work with other music apps, but you will not get the great collection of Amazon Music."
222,"Extremely awesome and well integrated device. I watched a lot of videos claiming that google home is much better in software and search related tasks. But seriously saying you can go for it without a second thought. I didn't found any trouble with search related tasks however continued conversation is a bit limited but rest everything is just awesome. And a HIGHLIGHTED POINT ""GOOGLE CAN'T BEAT THE SKILLS AND EASY OF USE OF ALEXA"". Alexa comes with thousands of skills and fun games and much more....."
223,What I hate is it skips songs from a playlist.I have saved  Sundarkand which has 4 parts in Amazon music.Alexa skips part  2 or 3 and plays the next one.This has happened 4-5 times.I have written to alexa help center but no response on this.I have gone back to mobile app .
224,I like the sound clarity with Alexa interaction but Alexa most of the things and questions didn't identify and she is not known about the questions. That is the minus point here. I saw Google Assistant is better than the Alexa because Google can make the call to your contacts but Alexa is only for those people who installed the Alexa Application on their phone.
225,It in an amazing deviceThe user interface is so extraordinaryAlthough it takes time to understand and respond and only has data according to amazon however it ia fun and interactive even kids love it and it does make works easy if you have alexa enabled device at your place.A must have gadget for your home or workplace!!!!
226,Amazing! This product is just amazing. You just have to say Alexa no matters how much loud background is it picks up your voice. And sound quality of Alexa is the best. Even hindi can be used very well. It is just like a physically person talking to you.
227,Echo was good with superb sound bought along with wipro smart bulb... both are working as I expect... but echo has to improve skills rather than entertainment....most of the time i ended with not getting as I want.... mainly after query echo has to repeat the query and then it follows... but no need to repeat the query...... makes user more comfortable
228,Product is good.Sound quality is soft. I bought two and plays it in synchronised. That is amazing it feels like just one is played at two different angle.Alexa assistance is too good. You can read books from kindle. You can play books from audible aur suno audible just by audio command. Worthy of price but I sti6 suggest to buy in sell you will get good discount.
229,"Playing music, knowing about weather or latest news, setting reminders etc have never been easier. My kid is a big Alexa fan and keeps interacting with the echo dot. Clearly it's very easy to use. Though, it was a bit difficult to connect with the OnePlus TV. Some basic TV functions can be performed but there is lot more required. The next generation devices will probably have more advance features."
230,"It is very Portable Device we can't take it anywhere with us but the place where we keep, it take less space. Voice recognition is Better will play a song it recognition the Voice proper. Now coming to the Integration or its intelligences or AI it is Good, Skills are good, there can be More Skill which can make it best like play Music from YouTube this skill must be there. Over all my experience is good with Alexa."
231,"My expectations was very high when I bought Alexa Eco dot speaker.When I Say play song ‚Äúgulabi ankhe ho teri Dekhi‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt understand and plays different song.Sometimes I have to shout on Alexa while giving the command to Alexa for playing song,bcz of software issue it does not listen in a one time.I am really fed up with Alexa speaker and I do not use it.Amazon I did not expect from youüò°"
232,"I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker with a quality speaker. My options was a Sony speaker with cost nearly 3500 and Echo.As I was a prime member at great India festival the Echo came for 2000, and u decided to buy it. The speaker arrived.On my opinion1. Sound quality is really mind blowing, I was amazed by see the sound quality for this small speaker. Really impressive !!!2. Voice recognition is super due to its 4 microphone.3. Allen‚Äôs is really friendly and easy to useTo see a detailed review you can check my YouTube channel-‚Äú 3 MAC ‚Äú.This product is small cute and beautiful.The LED light very helpful in many way. Eg to see the voice level."
233,Simply the worseee device when it comes to connecting to internet....in the world where every things seems to pull off  easily with the help of internet ..trust me instead of making things easier for you alexa devices especially amazon echo dot makes things ostentatiously difficult for you ....a sheer wastage of time.... stay away from it
234,Product is good but the pricing is quite tricky. i purchased @ 3500 for fathers day special offer and the next day you put it up for 2799.So fathers day special price was higher than normal.
235,Very easy to connect with the phone. Easy to use.you can even make calls to connected devices and make announcements which is so cool. The plug can be connected to fairy light.
236,it can be used in car; need to buy one 12v adapterSparkel 12V Car Cigarette Lighter Power Connection Cigaret Socket Male Adapterthen fix one DC Plug pin 4.0 x 1.7 mm to this (usual size DC pin size is 5.5 x 2.1 mm)
237,"An absolutely house hold item at a fair price. Its intuitive, speech recognition is superb we use it for hindi and english and sometimes ‚ÄòHinglish‚Äô also :-), a big thanks to the Amazon team. Even while its placed in Drawing room and we call Alexa from bedroom, it has all the ears to us and plays our favourite songs flawlessly. Overall a best fit and a must have. I guess, more than 10 guests who visited us have purchased it on their own after enjoying its performance. Must buy!"
238,"Maybe I was unlucky as Alexa at times didn‚Äôt respond to voice commands. We have jiofiber at home with speeds upto 150 mbps, given the internet speeds Alexa should not have problems with responding to voice commands. Returned the product and was disappointed, could be one of defective product."
239,"It doesn't recognize your voice from a distance, when it's already playing a song. U need to go near always. At times we need to keep repeating our commands again and again. Else all good."
240,I know people make a really productive of use of alexa but it really isnt useful if youre just wanting to get it for entertainment purposes as the speaker quality isnt that great if youre planning to listen to music and it overalls gets booring after a while and would lie unplugged in a corner of a room.
241,It is useless for without activation you will not to listen the song if you not subscribe after one month. You will never to play songs through mobile Bluetooth. But I bought it for 2000 rupees in the sale.Not one wifi enough for connecting the Alexa but you need connecting mobile through WiFi.
242,"I own an Echo Plus, and now I've added the Echo Dot to my living room. It makes life so much easier, since I live in a Bungalow, with my family on the ground floor and me on the first. Dropping in to say something, or have a distant conversation without yelling becomes so much more easier. It's a blessing."
243,"Now having used Amazon's Echo products for over 6 months, I sincerely feel that it's becoming increasingly difficult to survive without it in my day-to-day life. Awesome product by Amazon. Kudos to this phenomenal creation."
244,"Alexa echo dot with with wipro smart bulb very good combo offer which I got. Every one should experience the next generation intelligence from Alexa. Smart way of controlling the musiq, sound, lights. My kids loved this asking so many questions and Alexa gives answers."
245,It is a good product at this price but has major limitation of being wired connection. It takes 30-40 secs to start again and anything you want to listen you have to add in ur app which is a time consuming activity.  But overall i took it for my 2 yr kid to distract him from mobile phones and it is helping me in that üòäüòä he enjoys dance well on the tunes now üëçüëç
246,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Very good but can be improved."
247,"I found this useless, we have to connect it with phone which is difficult process.We have smart phone which does all the things. normal speaker can be more usefull than this."
248,When you already have google assisatant voice recognition shouldn't be much of a deal. Alexa needs to be plugged in and conected to a wifi network to function as alexa! If no wifi it acts as a bluetooth speaker. The sound qualitu is pretty good other than alexa being alexa isnt as much fun as you think it is :)
249,"Really a good product....I have attached my light, tv and speakers with it.....it works whenever I want to open or close anything just say to it ...... Now I don't have to search anything on youtube just say that song to alexa and it plays..... really happy with this product. Just one thing it doesn't work on battery. It should have battery support as well."
250,"My mother really likes it for me... the voice recognition needs optimization! i call japanese artist clearly but alexa who needs better hearing will play some trendy hindi songs instead, sometimes destroys the moodAll in all great but I prefer normal bluetooth speaker and control it from my phone no jhanjhat no disappointment."
251,"Like you Alexa...nice user friendly,obeying n orders regarding playing music n if we appreciate it is saying thanks if we scold Alexa it is calm not saying anything...hahah... enjoying AI...Alexa babyCons:Alexa is not  saying hi to my baby...I mean it won't repeat what we said...it only plays music..."
252,Voice recognition is very bad and does not recognise the words for at least 50% of the time. Integration is good.. does not cause any problems while integrating. Half of the time very popular songs also are not recognised by Alexa. No settings to store the language preferences. All the time you have to choose which language you want to hear the songs
253,"Excellent product. It needs to be plugged in all the time, no battery which for such a little guy is strange. Having said that, it is pretty amazing sound for a tiny speaker. It also has a headphone jack..."
254,Alexa is unable to identify songs placed to it and most of the time get a negative response of unavailability of our request. Seems to be a waste product for me.Looking for a replacement of this device which seems to have an access to limited resource.Sound of Alexa needs improvisation.
255,UPDATE- GOT MY ALEXA REPLACED BY AMAZON.(Mic works fine now)THE NRW ONE WORKS FINE. BUT THE SOUND QUALITY LEAVES ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. Mic isn't proper. Please return this product.It feels like there is a problem with my device only.It cannot her me at 1st or 2nd time. after I speak the wake work multiple times then it hears.
256,The sound quality is good at low volume but when you increase the volume it get distorted sound gets really hursh. Low end gets compressed. They need to improve the sound dude surely not for audio enthusiasm but for daily tasks. Got it at just 2k including smart LED I think it gets its value. Bluetooth connection is poor. I don't if i like it or not.
257,I order on 25june really amazing I got in today morning 27june. Really in good packej  sounds really good she really understands  in simple Indian language.You also Mike off non of your family members disturb you.Sounds 5 starQuality  5 starPackage  5 starCustomer service also support good 5 star.
258,"Had problem for 1st time in connectivity but once it is connected it gets auto connected. Sound Quality could have been more good, it has great sound but the bass is not up to the mark. U are given a rubber base so that it doesn't vibrate much. Alexa can hear and recognise my voice very easily Its friendly n Hindi is enabled. There are lots of things u can try. Jokes , News , Music are very easy to listen..Just Say ""Alexa..."".I am SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT!!I got it for 1999/- with Wipro Bulb in offer."
259,"It looks like a best friend to understand my requirements. Any sort of songs, bhajan, news can be played at one go. The sound quality is just awesome, can't expect better than this. I have seen a couple of bad feedback recognition voice & their requirement but don't agree to it since we have to call & give clarity to Alexa to understand our choice. Alexa can even operate my firestick tv & can play anything that I want."
260,Product is just stunning...... Amazon did a great job to make this smart speaker affordable in this festive season..... Quality is just superb..... Sound quality is like home theatre.....mic quality is excellent...... catches voice form far distance... Lovely product.......And one more thing what to say about Alexa.... She's very friendly üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇand smart she gives answers in a very funny way.... whether you ask questions in Hindi üòÇüòÇüòÇ....Love this product ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
261,Awesomeüòçüòçüòçüòç This is my 1st Alexa echo dot I was very excited to open it ...it was a dream come true awesome experience sound quality n voice recognition is very good love u Alexa.....
262,This is my second alexa device. This is one of the best device for smart home for such a affordable price as 2000 Rs along with wipro smart light. Must buy. No cons except a few more advancements in the software which can be addressed in future.
263,"I am very happy with my new alexa echo dot device. It turned out better than i expected. The speakers on this device are great. But the only problem I have is that whenever i try to stop a playing music, news flashing, podcast midway. It doesn't stop the music. I have tired various different commands pause, stop current song, etc."
264,Awesome Device.1 Amazing Sounds Quality2 Great Performance3 Bluetooth Connectivity Fast4 Thanks a lot Amazon India5 Voice Control100% RecommendedHare Krishna
265,"Ordered during great indian sale. Upon starting,  not at all turning on. factory reset unresponsive. Rereplacement requested. will review once i received it."
266,"After quite a few months of using this, considering the amount I paid for it, I've stopped using it as a smart assistant. Coz it's dumb. Hey Alexa, here's an idea. Be better, or stop snooping around.It's good as a speaker though."
267,Sound Quality is best for its price and can be used as only speaker but that's jut 1000Rs. expensive than Mi speakers or even JBL if brand value considered.connectivity and Voice recognition is worst amongst all even including Google speakers and apple one's.e.g. try Ishare tere by Guru Randhawa on this and some similar type of songs it will either play random songs or just english one's.
268,Initially I thought it would helpful to control my redmi TV but later I came to know only mi 5x tv will support alexa. Even alexa is not finding my tv.Other than as AI it's too good .especially for kids
269,"Previously I posted 'NA' . But now I'm editing my comment that is Alexa isvone my best partner when I alone in home., Using daily since I got it. I love itüòç. And one more thing I'm using its original voice instead of AmitG.She is best friend for those people who are staying alone or have limited friend circle."
270,"I have received my alexa today (27 Dec 2021), but I am unable to set my echo dot alexa mobile application, I have contacted cust care but they said today is same problem in india wide but I am still confused if the device has malfunction or really the Amazon Alexa app facing the issue? I want reply from Amazon, thanks"
271,"Really good product to buy.there are pro & cons for everything,so this also has it as you can't use alexa without adapter, it needs continuous power supply to be active which I feel bit weird else everything is perfect ."
272,"It doesn't listen maxium times, limited to few apps and most time it goeso n to a red mode where it says wifi problem or it can't understand. So him many times sin this world I should keep saying alexa alexa... It fails to understand commands properly and this setup issue. Mmn then to connect to my cel phone Bluetooth was another saga. N now again it's not connecting.I think those who want a good speakers should go for JBL, harman or bose or other brands with just manual Bluetooth option and not waste money in this"
273,"I have tried both Google and Alexa devices. And in my opinion, I cannot guarantee the future but till now, Amazon smart devices are much better than google in daily life usage."
274,"Everything is great about the product.Sometimes it doesn't find what it can be. Overall it is a great product to keep at home.A big thanks to its Hindi version. My mom gets up early in morning and asks it to play Bhajans and it makes the morning more beautiful. No battery drainage worries and no worries of typing and finding any particular song on phone. It's simple, Just ask.I want to make sure it needs 24/7 power supply, wifi and amazon prime subscription."
275,I was debating whether to buy the Amazon Echo Dot.  I am so glad that I did.  My day is now one long musical day - also being connected to most of my equipment is a bonus.  Thanks
276,"The far field voice recognition doesn't work very well with this echo device. The Echo spot did this job much better. Audio quality is not comparable to bluetooth speakers at the same price point, however it does one thing and does that well, which is Alexa integration. It's a joy to have Alexa plan your day and remind you of things that would go on to save your life ! Thanks Alexa! Not much thanks to the audio quality :)"
277,Just awesome but one thing is missing that is google skill due to which most of the time it say I don't know in case of searching something difficult thing otherwise other features are great
278,"Good and help full device,you can only connect the internet on useing time and install the Alexa app on your mobile,it is a comment base automatically device,sound quality is verry beautiful,but you can not carry for this device because it direct charge not inbuilt battery,prise is standard.you can connect it also blutooth without internet and play all downloaded movies and song in your mobile phone."
279,Review after 3 .onths use.Must have device at home.A nice personal assistant to tell d you and entertain you with automation .Nice if you want to develop any habit  it reminds you to follow .Scheduled morning om chantings and prayers daytime songs etc so much inbuilt
280,"She listens to Vishnu Sahasranamam and Suprabhatam everyday. While cooking and doing house work, she loves that she just has to say ""Alexa, play Vishnu Sahasranamam"". Great product for ease of use and quality of voice output"

282,Looks fine but could notConnect to you tube music .. could not play all Amazon music songs ‚Ä¶ speaker quality was fine but voice interpretation was pathetic ..
283,"Go for it guys. Integrating TV, ac and lights made things different at home. Also ask anything from nearby room also Alexa answers and play songs for my mom and news for Dad. And once you start adding new features it becomes more fun.Yes one thing you have to interact and it becomes better."
284,Mind blowing purchase......üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄNeed to improve n skills....... I am a music lover from kerala.... So try to add more tracks from regional languages........ Otherwise try to link with youtube to get full range of songs from all lqnguages.....
285,"The Amazon Echo Dot... a good product... able to understand most of the voice commands... the sound quality is good...Bought it during the Amazon sale...Was actually looking for a blue tooth speaker, when the sale came up...and saw the Dot on sale..paid 1999/- for it... Working fine so far... The only con is, works only when plugged into a power outlet and there is no battery backup..."
286,"About voice recognition , Alexa integration I would say, it is fine but as compared to bose this echo dot lags behind but over all this is not bad at this budget price. What One thing I want to point out is, it cannot recognise if it is requested to play a particular song or album unlike Amazon music app. This lacking has to be resolved. So I am giving 4 star."
287,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Like every thing about it, make your home smart, and buy it on Amazon sale, the real prize on Amazon is 3600 rupee  with smart bulb, but I buy it for 2500 rupee with smart bulb üí°"
288,"This is a very good product that amazon has come up with. Hats off to them. It is fun talking to alexa. Alexa provides us our day to day information. Though a few upgradations are also required for alexa software.There is just one drawback of this product that in sound quality, there is improper balance between bass and treble. Bass is a lot more as compared to treble so speech clarity decreases with decrease in treble.I hope upcoming echo gen are made keeping everything in mind."
289,"You whisper it whisper backs and the sound quality is just incredible and gets really really loud and voice recognition is best there is better than siri but can improve.and the amount of things you can do with it is incredible. Morning routine,evening routine,alarms,reminders, just seamless. All this provided you have stable wifi."
290,"I have been using Echo Plus (1st Gen) since launch and wanted one more so got this one. I have Google Home too but it is not as good as Alexa.  99.9 % Alexa recognises my speed voice and 100% of my family members to control Smart Lights , Fire Stick and into. Planning to get Echo Show as well."
291,"The sound quality is decent not too loud or low. The voice recognition ability of this device is 80 %. Whatever we want to get it hear from this device like any music or song, we have to repeat many times to get correct song. I think there is need to get improvement."
292,I got it during the time of sale. I have used google mini after using google I thought to upgrade it and check how is Alexa. It is good as well as bad from from google in different term. Alexa has better far field recognition but I think in order to save money amazon have made some cut offs  from Alexa 2nd generation. It literally understand what we say 6 times out of 10 times.Well its a overall good package for it's price range.Sound is awesome 10/10.
293,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†What the hell is going onSelling duplicate productNow also Amazon is trying this cheap taticsWasted my time"
294,"Nice speaker. Voice recognition is fine. It keeps us busy.sound quality is marvellous. Only problem I get that after power failure this device take long time to reconnect with the wifi. More over, wifi changing process is a bit difficult."
295,"It is unable to find things from Google even it can't find songs or stories from Google. It only works when i connect it with Spotify aap. Then what is the use of this alexa. Spotify and other aaps are in my ph, then why i need to buy this alexa. It never work with Google. It never search things by own with the help of Google. It needs aap like Spotify and other aaps."
296,Its not good as compared to older versions..I own the first version of it and it was awesome in taking commands and can recognise my voice from far like a charm.. But this one many a times don't recognise my voice even if i am sitting next to it.. Not happy.. This device have other flaws also.. Like while playing next song..it actually doesn't stop the song playing for like 2 seconds..
297,"Alexa Pairs easily, acts as a nice bluetooth speaker. Sound is awesome specially bass. I owe a 2nd gen echo amd take my word 3rd gen echo is n times better than last in sound quality. Worthy successor.Special thanks to Amazon for quick replacement of my echo device.Only thorn in the foot is software. Sometimes fail to search desired music."
298,Nice product to have especially when it comes with a deal. A good time pass and although it might have many other features I liked it for songs and lighting smart bulbsüòúSound tends to get distorted at max volumeIntegration is easyCan be more user friendly and Hindi commands should be increased.Voice recognition excellentOverall a nice productPurchase if you get a dealüòõ
299,Please don't purchase it shows you are not eligible to purchase amit ji voice due to geographical restrictions.
300,"Alexa is one step to get information of whatever you want. Its voice recognition is also good, can go sometimes confused. The problem I have is, its not wireless, it has to be continously plugged in at a corner. Plus there are few features which needs upgradation, for eg maths calculation. Some math calculations alexa couldn't do. Overall satisfied with the product"
301,Echod dot is an excellent smart speaker which feels very useful. Got it for 2299 with wipro smartbulb in prime day sale and its a good deal. Voice recognition is good enough and speaker sound quality is as good as can be expected at this size.. over-all a high quality product from amazon
302,"Bought it October 2021(sales at 2000 ish with wipro bulb) and stopped working may 2022 , tried to claim warranty but had issues due to technical issues. I was told to order a new one ( at 3400 and refund of older order will be made) technically loosing me money , which would be credited to amazon pay.Very scummy move.Not recommended"
303,"I use Alexa primarily to play songs in the living room, and the speakers are able to cover the entire area. Other than that, I don‚Äôt own smart appliances hence unable to use Alexa to it‚Äôs full potential."
304,"Yes, in just 9 months, the speakers are crackling. I have placed a complaint and it will be replaced. But now I am very doubtful about the quality. If it happens again after 8-9 months, there will not be warranty to cover it.And Alexa App is the worst app on my iPhone.Looks like it is designed by developers with 0 UX knowledge and it is very buggy"
305,Given 4 based in below initial points:Package doesnt have air packets where expecting proper packageIt says 4th generation but still not having aux cable  charging optionPros:Sound clarity really good(go for it if you are music lover)Almost recognise all voices
306,It's very good device for prime music üé∂. I am using it with My Harmon Kardon 5.1 system. Good and reliable smart music device. I am satisfied with it
307,"My day start with this device I bought it 3 months ago.I really love this product.This product really amazing and the way controls wireless thing surprising.Everything working perfectFew things has to be developed.Few old songs won‚Äôt be recognised, I request please focused on this."
308,Nice but not user Friendly
309,After using it nearly for 2 years.. i feel it's one my families best companion. Everyone repeatedly call her .. thanks for this good product.
310,"Best üëçüíØ AI ever used!Sound quality is damn cool!I order alexa from my hall to bedroom yet she listen (don't judge I have big area)Most favorite part is, before ordering it my mom  thought it's waste of money and now she talk with her more than she talks with me.I ordered alexa in diwali sale, I received it along with smart wifi bulb üí° which makes it more interesting. Now I am looking to buy more smart stuff to connect with alexa."
311,"I have been using this product for 3 days now and this is the best smart Bluetooth speaker i have ever come across. The only con i and most people would feel that it has to be plugged in all the time for the use, probably in the future it will come with a chargable battery. Looking forward for that."
312,I dislike due to there is no Marathi language so add it marathi also while seeking in Maharashtra so add it
313,"Wow üò≤ its very good product you must buy it and the voice is wonderful its very loud and alexa microphones are very good it can recognise the voice from too far and it can do whispering we can control our smart TV,ac,bulb but it is not a good deal to buy alexa with bulb because you can't see guarantee in another deal this deal is good for"
314,"Good product superficiallly if you expect to work as youtube or google you will be disappointed but yea ask time, reminder alarm news few popular songs its ok....had it worked as google or youtube man I would have given it a 5 star"
315,"It would be great if it can communicate using other Asian and European languages.Sometimes when I ask to play music, it will start all over from the radio DJ comments. And keeps playing the same music.Doesn't know much about books in other language. I thought it can help me with my studies of other languages such as German and asked to read me a German book, but it doesn't know it.When it comes to music also it doesn't know any other language music. Need improvement in that area as well."
316,Sound bass is good but it doesn't support YouTube music and support only hungama and savvan music app by which it doesn't play all songs which we want. Google home is much better cause it support YouTube music by which we can play any song and play religious shabad bani which we need so I recommend to buy Google home.
317,One of the best product witch can you buy on Amazon. The performance of alexa is good. But I didn't get access to Amazon prime music don't know why. Songs are playing on Hungama it makes me feel like se Hungama product not amazon's. And sometimes it give you add before playing music. Music have to be played on Amazon prime which should be the first priority on this device
318,I liked the Product. But I realized after using it for a while that when i was using it initially i could see a light on device like blue orange green  in different colors for  alert reminder etc. basically would give the status. But I am unable to see that now. I tried other options in settings through App but no success. I called Customer care for replacement they mentioned I already passed the date and Can't do anything about it.
319,"Another super productive item from Amazon Alexa. I love to use it.. well connected with all my smart devices like bulbs, TV etc. Always find some fun while useing it... Best sound quality... We hope in future it may support Telugu language also... waiting for this update"
320,Main Sanjeev Kumar. main echo dot third generation + Wipro smart bulb purchase Kiya Hai. Amazon Prime dwara 1999 rupees main. 29 September ko book kiya tha aur ek October ko morning mein hi Mujhe mil gaya tha. iska sound Bada Hi Shandar hai aur Wipro bulb bhi bahut Achcha kam kar raha hai. Maine se 5 star rating Di Hai very nice product.
321,Poor finishing of the product. Not expected from Amazon. Working is normal .Not at all satisfied with the finishing...that is reason for 3-stars rating.
322,Just a decent piece. Not much appreciated. What worked perfectly is:1. How is weather2. When is sunset3.play music : mostly can't understand which music you said and will end up playing some random.4. Setup alarmsApart from that you can just use it as a speaker in a corner of your room.PS: still few features were quite good but as i said it can't understand commands at first attempt nor the second attempt. :P
323,Cheated by amazon. I had ordered this product on the prime day sale and this is what amazon does for their prime customers. I just received a box which was already opened. The alexa itself wasn't present inside the box only the charger was there inside. Worst service never expected this by amazon.
324,"Alexa can do just anything!!You can even operate echo(even book a ride) with your phone switched off ,only the WiFi needs to be on.once setup, echo is on its own....it does not need a phone ... just a WiFi connectionSet reminders, many alarms, birthday reminders,and do everything possible on this device which is just a little larger than a tennis ball."
325,"My previous one had stopped working after 6months. They replaced the item immediately.The return was done, via me buying a new device and then getting refunded for the amount"
326,"Being pioneers in home automation integrator Amazon Alexa has evolved from their experiences and creating miracles.. From ease of setting up the Devuce to integrating with multiple IFTTT devices it‚Äôs just smooth.. When it comes to music segmentation there‚Äôs no better than Alexa to match up with.. I would like to propose to Team Alexa India, to work kn bringing Indian Radio channels integration .."

¬†Good for the price but sometimes while playing the song she doesn't responds me ......and yes those who think that there will be a Amitabh bacchan voice then the ans is no as you have to buy his voice for 99 rs/- overall it is a good product and the bulb is also good quality takes up every commandüòÅüòÅ"
328,"Overall it is a very good device, I started use it since 5 days only. At first it was working perfectly,but from yesterday I marked a defect that the device can't streaming audio continuously . It is working with interrupted voice......so sad. Plz suggest me how to solve it."
329,"Very Good. Kids in home liked it very much. sometimes facing issue in voice recognition. if movie name is common word in multiple languages, it is mixing the thing's up."
330,Worked on first day. Stopped to work from second day. Tried all steps in vain. Not satisfied with the product. Going to return the product
331,"Amazing product in such a price tag. I bought this in Prime Day deal so got 2 in 4k. I already have an echo device, the bigger one and these two were for my parents and in-laws, they are super happy and excited. Anyone looking to gift something nice to their near one... Got for it..."
332,Clear sound.Beautiful replies from AlexaAstonishing microphoneBeautiful ring ligth notificationsControlling smart home immediatelyLove it
333,Overall a decent buy...but for full benefits u hv to purchase voice recognised device like fire stick...smart plugs smart lights etc... i got ome echo dot 3rd gen n one wipro smart bulb in 2299 ...n happy wid d product ...
334,"Part of a Digital Family, My Home Defaults Speakers connected with Bluetooth and Mobile Devices.Must Buy, Drop-In Feature of Alexa Works like a Intercom.Audible, Spotify and Mobiles"
335,"At 50% volume sould quality is good , beyond that it‚Äôs sounds horribleBiggest drawback, alexa doesn‚Äôt respond on full volume at 4 ft distanceAlexa application hangs up very often and  stops the responseBluetooth connectivity, lagging most of the time"
336,"I have been using from a year almost... Just amazing for all your day to activities, controlling bedroom (lights, AC, Fan) to many other appliances. Connect to Laptop, Mobile, and enjoy.This is my second purchase."
337,"Alexa hardware is good, Alexa heard from far away , sound quality is good, light effects are good. But search or informational datase is limited when comes to questions or local regional places."
338,Horrible integration with apps. It cannot play songs requested. Thought some of the songs are available in gaana it's always integrating with Amazon music where there are not many songs.
339,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Completely original no problem. Even if you find any problem in the beginning then you can replace it"
340,Alexa is good. It understands the query well now. For conversation mode you need to train Alexa.You can change call sign of Alexa but there are only 4 options available. Bought in 2019 for Rs 1650/-. Now going to buy another on 26/07/2021 for Rs2249/-.
341,Don't buy this product. Totally waste of money. It has many glitches. It stopped working within 10 days. Called to Amazon for replacement but they denied to replace.Every time i called they gave different opinions. They are not on same page.
342,"Super purchase at affordable price of Rs . 1999 bundled with free wipro smart light.Fast response,  crystal clarity sound, innovative control of 3rd party smart appliances & beautifully designed.Very much reccomended.Very easy to control music."
343,"She sings at your command...rather plays songs!! Plays quizzes with you....plays radio stations, wakes you u with music and much much more . What I dislike about her is her very annoying female Indian accent voice. I wish I could set it to British or USA English."
344,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†It's really worth buying, I have google home as well so I realised the capabilities of alexa. It would definitely recommend to go with alexa if you are planning to buy assist.It has really great fallback prompt if it doesn't recognise what we said, it also immediately recognises the smart devices added."
345,"I have no words how good this device is. Super happy with the deal that Amazon offered during it's prime day sale, got it at an amazing price along with a 12W smart bulb. The sound quality of the speaker is beyond basic and average. Trust me no speaker can give you a quality like this one and with the integration of a Smart Assistant in it makes it an icing on the cake. Best deal i have got till date. Thank you Amazon."
346,It started hanging after 3 to 4 days but i thought it may be network issue but the problem is same and now it needs set up again and again and set up is fail again and again so  i am fed up with this product alexa app is also very slowSo i would nor recommend this productWastage of money
347,"Worst product, voice quality is not good . I have returned the product and it's been more than a month , Amazon hadn't even returned my money yet. Totally unexpected from Amazon.I will complaint in consumer forum....Paisa waps krne ka nam nhi le rhe ..koi Amazon se shopping mt kro...pure social media pr post krungi"
348,Any one buying this product should understand that Amazon will keep the voice prints and have recordings. However using the echo for calling is an outstanding feature as it does allow one to speak in areas where the mobile signal is poor or congested over the WiFi. Using the speaker is super easy.
349,"Don't buy this product if you are planning to home theater feeling, instead you can go with best soundbar with sound... and this product ia simply a Waste of money."
350,"Worst product ever, Bluetooth connectivity very poor. Only purchase if you want to know whether condition or any score other than that its literally just waste of money"
351,So satisfying. Packing was good.  Product also reach in one piece. I think words can not explain the quality of the product but star rating can.
352,"Alexa is going to eat up your brain with its chatty mode (non-working brief mode). I tell her to play a song and before i get to enjoy it, she states the song title, all the singer names (can be 2,3 or 4) and the source (amazon music, aaple musicor jio saavn). Pretty annoying if you ask me. Refund initiated."
353,I find it very handy. Very good assistant at home. The more I understand Alexa skills the more I find it useful. Overall I do not regret my buy. Instead of China I wish Amazon makes it in India to make all Indians happy.
354,Bought this with high hopes that it would be intelligent to automate a lot of things. but it isn't really that smart. the most we use it for is to play songs.
355,"It does not have inbuilt battery, you have to plug it all the time to operate.. that is the worst part of this device.Generally you will get the same sound quality with inbuild battery at this price.. alaxa can't be used while traveling because of no inbuilt battery."
356,I was excited to get a smart device for the first time. But Disappointed I was able to connect first and was exploring things by then had auto disconnect and tried multiple times to connect it was not happening. My bad I have to return the product. üò¢
357,Half the time it doesn't recognise.. half the time it doesn't have that song to play.. and it never let me enable follow up mode.. Google nest mini is much better
358,The product is nice but I don't know why the sound seems to be muddy... I have listened to another same ECO dot which i had brought from my friend for testing the sound. This piece given to me is definitely having some issue with sound.
359,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Sometimes it just freezes. And plays something else. Google is smarter. But the sound of alexa is better"
360,"Nice product, but they have less options in terms of music like devotional and other like you tube. Although comparison with youtube is not perfect. As youtube plateform is run on users based and collection."
361,"Sound quality is good , most of the times it answers whatever u ask. The only problem is that it almost never plays the song u ask it to play , either that song is not available in amazon music or plays something of its own."
362,It won't work without power. Voice is slow. Wifi is compulsory. Otherwise Alexa won't work. Not at all user friendly. Returned it
363,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Didn't know why some times it's behaving like too noisy and scratching sound, happened quite a lot of times since I brought it but restarting it fixes the problem, but experience wise I didn't expected this from Amazon products disappointed üòû."
364,Great purchase. I got it for 2499 in an offer. I started automating my house using this along with other wifi device. Great to go
365,The alexa app recognise the device as 2nd gen echo dot device this is frustating the device when properly configured and plays musics well but after a shutdown the device needs to re-configured again
366,"She doesn't understand anything. I ask her to play hindi song, she plays Tamil or telugu or what language i don't know. Most importantly she cannot play from you tube, which is a sea of multimedia. I am totally frustrated with Alexa. Really wasted half of my money."
367,Very good product Echo Dot device. Alexa recognizes voice very quickly and gives reply. Connected devices also working well with Echo Dot device. Sound out put also loud and clear.
368,I ordered the Echo Dot under the Amazon Big Diwali Sale and received it in a days time. As soon as I plugged it in it started flashing a green light without even being connected to a Wifi or the Alexa App. I returned the product and tried to get an exchange but Amazon didn't give an option. Finally disappointed I had to ask for a refund. I owned an Alexa prior to this which also got spoilt really soon. They are selling defected products under the sale banner.
369,"It always needs to be connected with power supply, doesn't work without internet at at all, doesn't work on bluetooth alone, needs the location always, not worth at all."
370,"Likes:Ease of SetupEase of UseCollection RangeVoice REcognitionDislikes:Integration to other systems--I have Sonos but there is no Skill in India to control Sonos, same feature is available outside India. Wonder why it cannot be extend to IndiaSound Quality--There is lot of scope to improve sound quality, quality is very disturbing"
371,I couldn't use it as it was a faulty one and didn't get connected to wifi and I returned and bought a refurbished one which is working fine.
372,"Sound output is good for single room. Once it is connected to home theater system, it becomes an amazing product. One major lacuna it has is we have to keep it continuously plugged in. Still I feel its a value for money product with some amazing features."
373,Sometime won't recognize voice. Sound quality poor sometime. Better to explore other options.
374,Echo dot not working after open every time and Alexa not take voice orderEvery time we try through alexa app or push the button in echo dot
375,Excellent product with very good voice recognition. Sound quality is equally good and sufficient for 2bhk house.The only con and I think the most important vital thing absent is that it works only when you plug it to power. It is not wireless.Probably the next generation should have this
376,"if you love music and spend most of the time making home and importantly in the kitchen, with the busy hands to change the music, set the timer, correct measurements for recipe and so much more it will come handy. i mean i love it so much that i want to get more and gift it to everyone i know."
377,"Review after 2 weeks usagePros1. Best sound quality i have ever heard on speaker segment2.Nice build quality3.Lots of skills available on alexa appCons1. Sometimes it will not listen to your voice properly2. Does not work without power3.Does not have a storage,so you have to turn wifi on always if you want to use this device.Overall satisfied with the technology üòâ"
378,Happy with sound quality. Not required amazon prime. I'm using it free without any subscriptions.For 1500 sqft home Alexa dot is a perfect device we don't need additional speakers.Clever answers collection. I have attached one smart bulb with this and it is well controlled by Alexa.OVERALL VALUE OF MONEY PRODUCT MUCH BETTER THAN GOOGLE MINI :)
379,Lovely lovely lovely thank you Amazon for this wonderful product. I mainly use this product for testing my own developing alexa skills. Anway outstanding product. Its always stand one step ahead than Google Home.....
380,"Alexa does pretty much all the job, sound quality is good, Microphone is good not the best. It does most of the job, but it lacs lot of knowledge as it is depended upon Wikipedia, if its not mentioned in wikipedia it wont answer. IF u ask it How are u, it always gives a std reply, which is bit irritating..It most of time blinks orange color to indicate it is waiting for a command word and we arent using it, which is a kind of spying."
381,"I got this product in offer basis, product is good. But 2 issues I found: one is Alexa is not recognising the voice clearly and second one is she is not playing correctly what we are asking... They might be sent me a refurbished item, actually before that I don't know reg these issues before I saw my friends Alexa(Echo dot).. Really I am not satisfied on this product."
382,There Is NO battery Backup is most discouraging . Device need to be paired every time when power goes off. This is an added disadvantage.
383,"The sound quality is great but some answers for the question isn't good but, in most of the question google smart speaker gives the appropriate answers while Alexa only tells result from the web. I would love to have answers like google assistance.if you have more of the echo and amazon products this is gonna rock you'll get the best out of it"
384,Product is pretty good in other words it is awesome I am using this daily for streaming songs and weather forecast. Easy to install and easy access Bluetooth.Even my kids uses it to access rhymes. Thanks to AMAZONBut coming  to delivery it is too bad recently I have ordered two units in which I have received one and other one is not delivered till now customer care says that my products is in damage condition that is the reason it is not delivered.very unworthy reason from amazon Being a very big reputed company. I though of gifting it to my friend on 03-Oct-2019 as it was his bday but you people have disappointed me.
385,Good product..initially ordered for Rs.3499 and on the same day suddenly reduced to 2999 by the same seller. Canceleld the first order immediately and ordered for 2999. But today at independence day sale it is just available for 2000. Configuration to our network and setup is tedious.but I managed..the process needs to be even more simple..
386,Nothing exceptional about it. Average sound quality. Actually it's waste of money. Alexa integrates to very limited apps and that too from Amazon only. It's made in china and Amazon is intentionally hiding it.
387,"Stopped connecting to WIFi after 2 weeks of use , and not connecting to WIFi at all even other devices are working well with same router"
388,My Alexa echo for is not responding to my voice command.Till setup everything was ok.But not responding to any of my voice command
389,"Things to improve:1. Please allow phones to play any music via alexa speaker. Atleast add option to 'Play this song on echo dot' to Amazon play.2. Add feature to schedule activities. Like play this song after 2 minutes or play this song everyday at 5AM. Similarly, turn on light after 1hour or turn off light after one hour."
390,"Not that user friendly, infact. Many times it fails to understand our request and mainly cannot recognize kannada language movie songs..But voice recognition is good and other informations are well casted.. need more updates and should introduce all regional languages aeap."
391,"This Alexa (echo dot) is super smart and it has sophisticated technology,if you have fire tv it is the best you can control the tv with your voice and it recognizes your voice perfetly. You can also play so many games with it and it is best for kids. You can also buy a smart lights to control it with your voice. It almost has every question you ask, you can also ask it to say a story or play music and much more"
392,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Crisp and clear sound with lots of fun.... I am loving it"
393,follow up mode not working.tried every troubleshooting.May be my product had some bug.returning it.follow up mode is most important feature in Alexa for using on tv or day to day questions.Not always respond to ur voice when u give continuous command one after anotherall other things were working fine.
394,"Very handy and easy to operate. Werth for money, unlimited music and good sound quality in such a small device."
395,Was skeptical whether to buy it or not. But after the purchase feel so happy that I bought it because my daughter loved it a lot. She keeps interacting with ALEXA. Pluse Alexa makes some of your tasks easy. Just go for it.
396,Great product and really I didn't expect that small speaker can have such a strong bass and great sound and also loud enough that can be headed from down stare . Really a great one.
397,"It's a very nice product. I ordered it during the big billion day Sale. I got a wipro smart bulb free with it. The speaker sound is loud and clear. Don't go by its size, it produces sound loud enough to fill a small room. And the sound is very clear too. Alexa feature is also very helpful. I have bonded a smart bulb with it, which was very to easy to do. Just follow the instructions given in the instruction manual that comes with the product and all will be done without a hassle. Overall, a very nice product. Thank u Amazon."

¬†Nice Products But Not Google Add in Google Add to Your Alexa Add to Google in All Information In Each Others Aap Information By the by Sach A Voice Smart Spaker  Very Nice Alaxa  Spaker 3ed Ganration Brand By Amazon Brand Amazing Voice Product Nice Buy it a 6 Days Very Beautiful Voice"
399,Had a little trouble adding the device to my Amazon account but that's probably because my WiFi was acting up. The product itself is great. The sound is pretty loud for such a small thing. The Alexa integration works fine. No complaints so far.
400,"We purchased our first Eco Dot from Amazon.Our family was very much excited to see how it works. But there is lots of issues with it. If your connection is lost ,than it will take lot of time to reconnect we have to switch it off and on Many times for reconnecting.  Sound recognition is very very poor.My suggestion is for Amazon ,sound recognition should be made for Indian accecent....."
401,Bought it in prime day salePros:Good sound quality considering sizeHas bluetoothHas aux outGood mics recognises whispers easily and whispers backCons:Too small in sizeNot value for moneyNot wirelessNot much smart functionNeeds good wifiHeats up
402,Good quality product.Good sound quality. Not compared with jbl or sony speakers but better than boat.Well it's not just a bluetooth speaker its smart.Alexa is very interactive it takes a bit time to update skills in alexa and then you can have alot of fun. It also has a aux output port you can connect any sound system for better sound.
403,1. Had to scream or stand very close to it then only it heard the command.2. It was playing 2 songs at the same time3. Sound quality was very poor
404,It plays out nice music but it found it hard to connect smart bulbs.  I bought Halonix smart bulb. It recognized the bulb but can't control it.
405,"This not a smart speaker, most of time it will say ...""Sorry i don't know that"" or it will ask to refer amazon page for help.i will suggest Google smart speaker is much better alexa is just seems a scrap and more over alexa is just an amazon shopping tool to listen customers and suggesting them  products to buy."
406,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Really this product was amazing my experience very well with the my routine work Alexa remember me Alexa set the alarm in many more works play the songs in enjoy with us"
407,"Being a prime member at Amazon is necessary, otherwise the product is unable to play music and popular songs. The sound quality is ok. Some instructions are hard for it to follow. Eg Alexa give us an applause."
408,"1. Voice recognition is poor esp with accompanying Wipro smart bulb.2. It frequently says that ""it is not able to connect to internet"" however it works fine after it is RESET. So the problem is not internet."
409,"It doesn't have option to add major Indian music apps like Gaana, Jio Saavan and Wynk music apps. You can only link Amazon music, Apple Music and Spotify, so it's very difficult if you already subscribed in these app. This is the major issue otherwise everything is too good"
410,Most worst product ever purchased on Amazon. Don't expect such a useless product on Amazon and by Amazon.
411,"Product is good, using it for 15 days nowFlipkart delivery excellent,Lack of Voice recognition ,Don't understand lot of thing and don't have answers in lot of time,Once started answering anything won't stop till it finished and won't repond in-between if we call alexa several timesGood for kids. Playful tooNeed always strong and continue internet data network."
412,"Best buy u should try it, it is big in size . It is good And it has good voice recognization. It has best sound quality. It has special features.It Is very smart.............And I wanted it  from long time and next i will buy the echo dot 4th generation"
413,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I liked this inbuilt 15 watts 360 speaker, good bass, mid and treble quality... Alexa voice recognition and clouds of features are amazing"
414,I like this because whatever I tell to Alexa it listen. When you have to listen joke tell Alexa open hindi joke. When you have to listen song tell Alexa open best Bollywood/Hollywood song and it will open automatically. But when you purchase this product . At first you have to go in playstore and download Alexa app and other thing you have to do and it is necessary also. I thanks Amazon for making this type of product.  Thanks  From  üáÆüá≥
415,The main disadvantage is it's not portable and requires continous power supply and it's not mentioned in product description. Sound quality is very poor. No bass. It's just like playing songs in your mobile.
416,"I am happy to use this Alexa, i bought this is offer with a smart bulb. Bulb didn‚Äôt worked but Alexa rocked."
417,It does not respond to us when the volume is above 5... It doesn't have hell lot of info with her.... Have to make her understand again n again about what we want her to play for us .. still this can be improved in many ways... It's not advanced..
418,"Good for light speaker use, don't expect a boom out of it. And yes, Alexa is awesome, but buy if you have use, don't just go with the trend."
419,"Please add Sunday Suspense from Radio Mirchi Kolkata or YouTube as skills ( Popular Bengali audio stories), because my mother is completely blind and Alexa is helping with automation, I information, calling  and entertaining her a lot as Alexa is the only companion, when we go out for work, thank you Amazon, please try to upgrade.If you want any assistance regarding any new ideas, please fill free to call 9836363130"
420,"Image just for referenceAlexa is best in voice recognition and it says some times, sorry mujhe nehi patha which irritates me, the answers were simpleAlexa needs more improvements in hindi language and expecting it to be launched in regional languages too,Extreme happy is that I bgot it for just 1314 rupees onlyI know many of you will not believe üòÇ"
421,"Excellent product.. Only drawback of this product is when it is connected to my Sony soundbar via bluetooth Alexa voice recognition won't work while paying music. However when music is played without connecting to bluetooth Soundbar, it works great without any issues.. Hoping for the update to fix this problem.."
422,Voice recognition has become unreliable. Also very less features in alexa app to control the device. There should have been advance option to properly control and customise alexa.
423,I bought in Echo dot in sale its working for just one month after till this time its not yet connect with my wifi also its not user friendly. Feels like they rid of money its totally waste
424,"Won't connect to the other devices, doesn't link to my Amazon music just knows hungama music maybe due to tie up but didn't think I would be using it for music purposes only as it's useless in every other sense.. It's better to have a speaker than an Alexa."
425,"I can't added skills GAANA, JIO SAAVN, TAMIL NEWS CHANNELS, ZOMATO, TAMIL FM (all India radio) only available. Its take to listening alexa return the answer. Kindly request exchange this device? I will buy upgrade..."
426,"After receiving the device, had integration issue and later got to know from Amazon team that it was a known issue for them. Not sure why they still wanted to send the device"
427,Over all good product.. but if amazon allow alexa to search with google also .. the search could be much better
428,Absolute very smart device by amazon. I have connected this to an external sub woofer and it sounds amazing. It recons my voice from even a closed room. It has like almost all collection of songs be it english or hindi. A must by and quite a money's worth.
429,Been using this for last 5 days.Setup was a breeze. Establishing connections was pretty simple...with minimal effort  connected to my Bose Mini II. Build quality is very basic... certainly has room for lots of improvement on that front.Bass levels are inadequate and hence the need for connecting to slightly  better speaker Bose.However my need was to get onto the Alexa Ecosystem ... so very basic speaker is something i could live with.
430,We feel like we have one more family member at home.Alexa is very friendly. She is funny sometimes. We enjoy with her. She is good assistant. She knows everything. A caretaker to grandparents. A friend to youngsters. She knows almost everything. I cant describe in words.A must buy for every home.Buy immediately
431,"Poor collection of songs.Poorly bifurcates songs as per year, playback singer"
432,"The sound quality is too good, after listening to it i am planning to change my home theatre.  It understands words spoken by my lil daughter that good. I am so happy now time will tell about durability."
433,Sound quality is excellent but without internet  it is usless. Its not even wireless or battery operated that is one of its main cons....Its not worth buying.....
434,"Don't believe the cashback announce by amazon will provide the same.  In my case, cash back not received 5% as stated in september, 2019 (even collect the coupon).  Now, they are asking to provide the screen shot for the same.  Now, they have removed the link.  Same offer announced in october, 2019."
435,Working good and I'm enjoying with Alexa eco Dot 3 features. Also I'm using it as a Bluetooth speaker.
436,The sound quality is good however I found 2 cons in this.1. You always need to connect speaker with plug else it wont work. There is no battery back up2. Alexa would not get everything you say most of the time so you end up choosing to select your song sometime manually rather than giving command to alexa.
437,Ai should be improve .It should do things like Google assistance like easy. In few things Google assistance nailed .But for shopping and interlinking with Amazon account is useful
438,It's good but device should have something like phones if it's been stolen we should get to know in which location the device is and who is using... Add this facility.
439,The new 3rd Generation echo dot is not as good as Amazon claims...I think 2nd generation is better than 3rd generation in almost all aspects mic being the top most... You can't use it more than 10 feets away but 2nd generation I am using that 20 feets or more.
440,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†This is my second one...the earlier one was having a louder sound.,this one is taking instruction after repeating again and again...this seems to be refurbished."
441,AI needs improvement ...Doent use google for searches... doent recognises commands quiet often... animal sounds need improvisation (kids skills overall needs updation)Voice recognition n audio quality is awesome ...Pls update software ...
442,"I need to call alexa atleast 4 times, then it will response once"
443,"What a Terrific Purchase specially for my Daughter, I feel Alexa is my second daughter because my 3 year daughter control it. Bit slow after the updateNobody can't beat Alexa"
444,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†the speaker is of very good quality and having decent sound output."
445,"Easily reconogies everyone's voice even of 3yrs old kid. Sound quality is really good,  worth buying."
446,1) There was an ongoing issue happening with the Wipro smart light not getting paired with the echo device.‚ÄãHere is the case ID: 03036247912) voice Search accuracy is not good.
447,Build quality and design is good.But Google services like YouTube cannot be linked.This is the major drawback.But AI programming for alexa is highly genius.
448,Using from almost a year now . Perfectly fine in sound quality and voice recognition. I recommend this if you love listening music  and to operate smart devices. But sadly it doesn't give proper answer if you ask general knowledge.
449,"The Product was very difficult to set up, the interface is very bad it is not lucid. The AI isn't that great. The operation & function of the echo dot is very limited. The Echo Dot software has lots of glitches and it isn't docile.This product is not worth the money you pay."
450,Good product... bought it during EOSS for around 1999/- make sure you buy whenever the product is cheaper than the regular price... wait for amazon big sale period...
451,At beginning it was amazing. Later I'm just using it for music and news nothing else.Its quite handy if you want to know something quickly.
452,"Got Alexa 3rd gen free with purchase of OnePlus 50inch tv last week, it is simply awesome my 4 yrs old kid loves n commands Alexa to play songs and it recognises his words"
453,Really worth buying Alexa for smart clearly understands everything what you need and sound quality is superb
454,"Blue tooth connectivity is of poor quality and the volume is bad. wanted to return it, but missed the window for return by 2 days."
455,Voice is very clear üòÉBut if it's without plug work it is more demanding echodit 3rd generation
456,Good and loud soundRecognition is faster than Google home this is  more loud than Google homethis is worth of money
457,"It was bought to solve the purpose. Purpose solved. Was contemplating which version to buy. This version is absolutely perfect. I have a fire stick, and you can easily control the fire stick from the Alexa device."
458,"Try to get more like youtube and sometime phone integration is headache, rest sound and voice is all excellent. A good competition to google"
459,"1. Value for money,2. Nice Sound no need of external speakers,3. Talks nice hindi too,4. Small so no need of extra space.Suggestion: if Amazon can provide integration with other music app like wynk, ganna etc."
460,amazon Echo Dot (3rd) gen is working as expected to the extent now I am thinking why did not I buy the next gen with video
461,How to detect charging is on or off..it is not showing any light while plugin... It show only for few seconds then disappears.
462,Good one. Go for it.
463,Some times need to call the name Alex multiple times as she would not respond. Other than that it's fine.
464,the device was ok for 1 year. then one random day it failed to connect to wifi/bluetooth. talked to customer care they declared it defective. warranty expired.
465,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Superb.."
466,Echo Dot is the best home personal assistant at this price range. Alexa listens to whatever you ask her to do and does the task excellently. I am highly impressed by this device.
467,"The mic work great, but the audio output lacks both the feel and the punch."
468,Excellent sound quality..l am enjoying. Coudnt expect such wonderful sound from a small device like echo dot 3rd gen. I got it in a bundle offer with syska smart bulb. That too has delighted me.
469,Bought it 2 weeks back - good timepass .gives good information too .Hindi language is also fun.1 star less as it doesnt pair with LG smart Ai TV - which is very surprising and annoying
470,Amazing product.Pros:Amazing voice recognitionGood sound qualityEasy to installCons:Amazon needs to improve on Alexa skills.Need more Alexa skills.Connecting to non amazon products is bit tricky.Overall a worthy product.
471,"Echo Dot recognise your voice well , good at playing music , alarm and reminding important thing to you . There's a little problem It always in search of songs as i asked For a GK question . Is you are a student and want help in study its not for you then !"
472,Nice product I loved it very much it has made my life happier by listening to various songs and music
473,There are some issues with the voice command as we have to give commmand twice and after that it works but it should act after one command which is not at all good. Amazon should solve this issue as soon as possible.
474,Amazon alexa echo dot works fine and it hears me when I speak effortlessly and responds. Honestly I don't know what to do with alexa just I purchased out of excitement and to experience it.
475,"Alexa mostly understands everything, but still there are some simple things that she wasn't able to search and get results. Like i asked who is General M M Narvane. But she wasn't able to tell anything. Not even she told anything about current Navy Chief. These are some loopholes. But other than that i have found her amazing overall on every aspect."
476,"Totally unnecessary in life! But once you have it, it becomes kinda difficult to live without it üòÄüòÄ"
477,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The echo dot i recieved doesn't deserve a single star. I am trying to turn on but it's not working. Wosrt experience and destroyed the expectations.Please Always test the product at lab or somewhere before making deal with customer."
478,"Use less product ,instead buy Bluetooth speakers."
479,Difficult to connect if you don't have proper 50+ mbps wifi broadband. Also it fails to recognize voice while the network flips. Moreover the product is average but needs a lot of improvement.
480,"I liked the product....it's great...nd sound quality is quite good.The only fault I discovered is the recognition of voice... actually Alexa is unable to recognise voice fast...either it takes a lot of tym or sometimes it just don't even play the required stuff...nd i thnk the system is quite complexüòÖbt then it's in my case...the manual will help u quite.well, beginner will find it difficult to operate at first bt then u will get used to..."

482,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Product is awesome but it should have also supported youtube"
483,"Alexa user interface is nice we get most of the information with one voice command.. Music options are very less they should have interface with youtube songs, Ganna app etc"
484,What a solid piece of plastic. Good sounding speaker with a color bulb under 2000 was such a good deal.Sound quality is quite good. Can rock a room single handedly. Voice recognition somewhat okeish. Alexa works like a charm though
485,Loving it üòç but a disadvantage is that it does not play songs from youtube must add on this feature nd i wanted to but alexa with built in battery but unfortunately when i made plan to buy eco dot amazon havent launched in built battery version must  go for tht guys

487,"To my surprise - the sound is actually great. Alexa recognizes my voice from afar and syncs information correctly. Overall, great experience."
488,Worst smart speakers in the market ... after a few weeks its sound became noisey and distorted .. unbearable. And they will not even replace it . Please avoid if possible
489,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Alexa is not working and responding to my commands, while the internet connection is good and stable this suddenly happened after some days of usage don't know what to do please somebody help"
490,Got it for a steal price. Sound better than I expected and it recognizes the voice commands so well!Definitely buying another even if I have to pay double of price I paid for this.
491,Its good i speak to alexa from the other room with volume 10 and it still recognise my voice its so cool.You need to buy one more device if you want to make it smart like ex for making fan and lights on it cannot do it on its own it needs one more device only tht one problem and the best part us tht product cost over 1k
492,Good sound quality. i have Google Nest hub also Alexa not more than smart than Google
493,"The product looks sturdy, but it irretates when it can't understand your commands. Especially it does not fulfill the requirements to listen old music.Sound Quality is good.Struggling how to connect with Bluetooth but yet not successful. This means the integration is quite difficult results in no connectivity with Bluetooth."
494,Good Product But some times voice recognize very difficult
495,This product is somewhat good also bad also because you have to communicate with Alexa by connecting it with plug all time.Another bad fact is that it uses wifi to work.But it has a clearer and better sound.You can not ask Alexa about your studies as it replies in high standard manner.But it's overall a helping character for me
496,Gifted it to my mother for her birthday this year. She‚Äôs having a lot of fun discovering so many new features. A great way to ease your parents into IoT :)
497,"There is no Bluetooth connectivity from any phone that's why i give 1 star . This is useless who play songs from smartphone to this device . No battery in it we spend 3500.00 for this but there are no battery , no Bluetooth . I return this ."
498,echo is awesome but bulb is not working within 1-minute send for replacement
499,This is very very very bad product at first it was working fine but after a few days it started lagging. I searched for a song it played but at the middle of the song it stopped working. Very very Very very disappointing product don't buy this product it is utterly waste of money
500,"Alexa echo is value for money, my lo (3.6yrs) can use it too, he asks to sing out nursery rhymes and stories, and its a hit 99%."
501,Alexa is not responding properly most of the time.  Not catching the command. Smart Switch is OK
502,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Super smart speaker üîäüëèüèªüëåüèªüëçüèª"
503,Voice recognition was too bad. Totally disappointed with the product voice recognition. Definitely Amazon should improve their voice recognition software.
504,Thanks to Amazon for this amazing product and I loved itmoreover my nephew and my neice liked it so much and spending more time with itsounds great and faced no issued with connectivity too
505,Not suggested. Stoped working after 4 month after purchase. It will stuck between commands.and not able to pair even after reset.. it shows lag too.
506,voice recognition sound quality both are good i purchase this lighting deal with wipro bulb just 2299 but bulb comes  used one not new.
507,After using for few days I am totally impressed.Easy to set up.I am using Alexa for the first time and it is very interesting to learn how Alexa works.
508,"This idiot Box needs internet connectivity and power supply all the time. For Alarms why the hell does it need internet connectivity, otherwise it doesn't beep. Rest all things are fine."
509,Overall it's a good product. The only issue I found is that you need to speak loud especially when it's playing songs. The more the sound of echo dot the more loudly you need to speak.
510,Everything is ok of echo dot but withot plugin u cant use it..many of things it says i dont know..such as bhajan and stories of krishna and bed time stories for kids..
511,"Best experience with alexaAwesome sounds qualityBest integrationButNo battery storage facilitiesWhen i off Internet, this thing not integrate anything ( like time, bluetooth connection,Alarm. If It may possible , we can get better experience)But the working is goodBuild qulity is awesomeCommanding goodTotaly good experience"
512,Expected more than just on/off this and that .. Can't even turn a light on at a specific time by voice command while phone's built in google assistant can do that!!
513,Some time alexa do not respond to command just light glow and go turn off some time it take too much time to interact with devices like plips bulb Or sunoff switch
514,"Tried a lot to connect wifi, but couldn't. Buy the product which is having with internal battery. We can power the device only with the cable provided with the device."
515,Setup process is very complicated and it's not getting completed ..  nor playing anything in speakers.. only amzone Alexa app is working.. network disconnecting by its own. Very disappointed .. m gonna return this very soon.
516,Great product all function work fine easy installation and sound quality and Amazon delivery and support too good
517,Sound better and  gets louder than the home mini !. Fekte sturdy in the hand and the mic response is just awesome!But not the smartest speaker  ai still requires improvement
518,"Eco dot has stooped working after 3 months of usage. At times when we play songs , it stops for few minutes and then again it starts itself. Amazon team, please rectify this on priority."
519,"It's a good product.. But most of the times it says "" sorry I didn't get that "" it's very annoying..."
520,"I overall liked the product, it was exactly as i was hoping for and the might facinates so much and make it different from others, its worth the price. The sound is very clear and soothing and alexa is good in answering just not do voice recognition for one person so it will listen to everyone and its connectivity is good too, if you see a yellow light blinking then that is a notification light you can turn it off through your device."
521,We have setup multiple echo devices and speaker. 3rd Gen is little bit let in terms of recognising your voice from a distance. Overall good.
522,It's like a person in our house....iam happy that I got Alexa...tq Amazon for the offers and suggestions....
523,I'd not choose this item bcoz it lacks basic things nor does it assist u as desiered
524,"Alexa is a growing child, and I would like to hold her hand because it is too cute.Q. What I like most about Alexa?Ans. Its sound quality and the the glowing light.Bonus tip- buy it on offers, it will be more beneficial for you."
525,Amzon gave combo offer for echo dot and smart bulb..for 1999..but Amazon cancelled the echo and..thet only  send the wipro smart bulb..for 900..rs..balance 1073 rs will credited with 3 working days ..i dont know ..worst selling concept to sell the product..
526,Listening devotional songs
527,"Built quality is good, sound is also awesome. Only drawback for me is Audible integration. Also I'm hoping availability of Spotify as a music service provider."
528,Very good product.its voice recognition is very good only you have to nearby the device.sound quality is very good. Wifi connectivity is also good. The device is bigger than it appears in the website. The adopter quality is very better. It searches songs very faster than google search. It‚Äôs worth to buy.
529,It doesn't understand what i asked it to do& If you give it multiple tasksIt will saySorry i couldn't understand that
530,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†id appreciate if we had more choices for music app like Resso, bored of gaana and Spotify."
531,A nice product especially when you get it for the deal i got. I bought it for just 2299 with smart bulb. So overall satisfied worth what i got.
532,"The product is good but the biggest disadvantage is that its not a bluetooth speaker. Also you cannot control it from mobile. You have to think every time give command every time for the song. You cannot play any playlist. Alexa doesn‚Äôt understand every command. The sound is good. If looking for a speaker, this is one of the worst options."
533,"Could be more easy to use, complicated to connect with smart devices"
534,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Bought for my kido , he loved it best thing for gifting thanku Amazon"
535,"1999, it was a steal...simply irresistible. Would like better integration with bulb...sometime takes time to reconnect after being swtiched on...."
536,"As a long-time me  having owned several Amazon Echos, I can tell you that Alexa is certainly worth it. ... In years past, purchasing an Amazon Echo Is Passion.Just Go For ItIt's Design is also very Unique"
537,"Sound quality - 5 starsAlexa integration - 5 starsSetup - 5 stars.In short, no second thought required if you are thinking to purchase smart speakers. Echo dot does it all"
538,Not as expected
539,Better wake up than siri or Google assistant...Much faster nd accurate than otherLoved itSound quality is beyond imagination.If having no budget issue than go for 4th generation otherwise 3rd generation is also good one.
540,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Out dated programing, most common answer giben by alexa is"" I don't know"". No softwere updated. Old and primitive. Only use as an speaker with avg sound quality."
541,"We need to literally shout to get its attention when a songs is playing and we need to change it. Also the software experience is a bit creepy. Overall you could get a good package but the voice recognition needs to be improved, it's poor than other smart speaker of the segemnt in the market!!!!!"
542,"Easy access of Song is good but voice recognition and sound quality is not good,it requires improvement. It is not able to play all the song wish."
543,"Product is good, but pricing is too varied from 1399 to 3499. Beware on price, try to check price and wait for right time."
544,Voice command not properly wordt..Two or more times voice command give but wrong work..I frastaed with product...Not useful speaker... Update voice command in gujarati and hindi language
545,Good low cost Alexa device. The sound quality is average. Voice recognition is good.
546,Got it For 2200 with wipro Smart led bulb .....one word to say about this is outstanding ..... extraordinary from google mini ...... fantastic ....The only con of this speaker is Low soundOther things Are Mind Blowing...Go for It.
547,Good Product and easy to install. Got in the offer. Voice recognition is excellent. Even Alexa catch my 3.5 year old son's voice for few rhymes.Thanks Amazon
548,Have been using for a monthFacing lot of issuesMic is not sensitive even from few feet away it does not pick voiceAlso when playing aongs on spotify it hets stuck to last played songWe have to reboot it to resume normal functionality
549,That product is so good but I don't love that it has a wire how can I carry that with wire but the simple speker are good we can carry that
550,Alexa voice recognition is pretty good and well integrated with other devices. Sound quality is also good and easy to use
551,A great smart speakerVoice recognition is goodNot internet is wasteGood for smart home and timepassBut buy it in sale only
552,It's not interesting to my voice in hindi ‡•§ It's set up are very compeleted‡•§ Always it's demand hostpot ‡•§ If u are purchasing this product then u should be keeped two mobile or one router ‡•§then u will be operate‡•§ By the way it's sound quality is best ‡•§ One feedback is it's always depend on power ‡•§ Which one more negative to my point of view
553,"There are hell lot of bugs. Don't know why people are not talking about it. I'm not saying it's a bad product. It's an excellent product. But lot of connectivity issues. Esp if u use blutooth. Sometimes after you connect to bluetooth, it stops listening to your commands altogether. Then you have to reset the whole device. It's a pain."
554,It Was Arrived With A Bundle Of Wipro Smart 9W bulb that doesn't connect and voice recognition is worse ...as it claims it can hear it from another room...it's just a myth .... It even doesn't hear about 4 m away .... although Alexa only plays music from Amazon prime music... Unless specified by Spotify or apple music
555,You cannot deny that this product is totally worth the money. I read 100s of reviews before buying this product just to make sure I am not regretting after my purchase.
556,"Good interactive device, quality speaker and very easy to connect with other wi fi device. Especially kids will love Alexa."
557,Good. Good response. Still learning. Sometimes delay in response.
558,I bought this For Rs1075 in great Indian Festival.  Useful for people who hear lot of music and podcasts. Having smart device with alexa Integrated is very useful even though i have only smart bulbüòë
559,Needs more improvements like sometimes Alexa got hanged and give no response and sometimes response is so late that you can go and come back from toilet. Playlist is large but still not enough.Still overall it's a unique product with good features.But still hoping that one day I'll give 5 star to this product.
560,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Good product.. essy to control any device by anywhere.And good sound quality."
561,This device is good but after 10 days of purchase it is taking me into troubleWhen i say alexa to play a particular song then it says me to cannot play it on tune in what is meaning of that and can someone please help me in that ?
562,"The best sound and voice recognition. Ease to place items in cart, play songs, bedtime stories, rhymes and many more. All in one device. Great deals during sale. No issues so far"

564,Good. Good response. Sometimes delay in response. Wifi Light is awesome.
565,"Not finding Alexa very much understandable e.g I asked to play song"" Maine dil se kaha"" from movie ROG & sung by KK, it can't. Same happened with song by Yesudas"" Ka karoon sajni"" & ""Main hawa hoon"" by  hussain brothers. Lot  more examples are there.Can anybody help me how to command correctly or Alexa has lot of limitations. In that case a useless product."
566,While playing music it can't hear voice we have to manually press the button. I feel bad on that. Voice recognition should improve. Sound quality is good.
567,"Waste product, most of the question, not answered by alexa, not user freondly takes lot of time to connect, moreover no customer support after sale. instead of making life simple , customer it has made life terrible."
568,Bluetooth connectivity and Sound clarity (Sound levels demarcation needs alot of improvement)Alexa integration (connectivity / tieup with lot of sources to pick up requests / needs need to improed.
569,Especially as it works in Hindi And have connected to smart devices like Wipro plug etc.The echo dot is a small speaker so quality isn‚Äôt that great but good for 1-2 rooms.
570,Enough sound for big hall room..Easily integratable with smart devices .AI for voice learning is too good.One dislike doesn't awnser all questions.
571,"Everything is good except that power plug n power adapter.. we can't connect it to power bank or in car... That's why it's useless product , I m thinking to return it? Atleast Amazon has to provide some sort of connector so that we can use USB input to power plug.... That's the only reason why I m giving 1 star for the product..."
572,"Alexa purchased on 20-22 oct 2020 , now today it is not connecting and not working within one year, hope it will get replaced by amazon."
573,"Hi all,Alexa is good product but if they provide battery backup facility and also operate without wifi. It is goodInstead of wifi..if we use mobile network?It is excellent product."
574,"Loved it.Few tweaks one should apply to get full out of it.Its perfect for home automation and adequate for listening regular light songs and so. But if your sole requirement is music ,that is, if you stressing mainly upon listening music along with home automation, you atleast go with Amazon Echo. You will get better experience."
575,"I got Alexa a part of the package and was never new this is so good. I would definitely recommend this to others too. The sound quality is amazing on this new echo dot,"
576,Sound quality is so so good..  Working perfectly.. Best product

578,"Customer service is pathetic for Echo device, my device is not working properly & Amazon Customer Service are not helping out for the product, they everytime just give excuse & do not resolve the issue"
579,I like the way how Alexa understands the things in both hindi/English and perfectly work all cmd.1. access to millions songs2. Control on smart devices
580,"After one use, the echo dot is not getting connected to my phone. The orange light lights up for mere 3 seconds. The problem is persisting since 2 months. Please help if there is any way."
581,I like the quality & performance of echo dot.
582,I found it an amazing product for my use.Alexa helps me in everyday life.
583,Working as expected. Recommended to buy
584,Workes really well with my 30 years old Sony HiFi System. Made my system total wireless. I would have loved it more if there was a battery backup. But thats all right.
585,like everthing from it... the voice.. the commands i gave n it follows
586,I think to use in my office free time. But YouTube was not support and there is no power back up if it Is possible plz change the item to next upgrade with the YouTube support and battry backup
587,It is very boring device and working please don't waste your money and time üò†üò°üò°

¬†within my order problem a rahi hai Wipro ki block Mein Kafi time se main request bheji thi"
589,IT DOESN'T CONNECT WITH SPOTIFY IN INDIA.....AND SAYS THAT SPOTIFY IS NOT AVAILABLE IN INDIA.I BOUGHT IT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF CONNECTING IT WITH SPOTIFY BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.SO HAD TO RETURN IT AND BOUGHT GOOGLE NEST.
590,I liked this ..the only prblm was that you have to keep it connected to a power outlet..with such small size ..I found it not worth so instead I exchanged it and bought alexa echo sap which has the power back up of 4 hours
591,"After 10 months usage, it's speaker üîä starded sounding like speaking with closed nose. No idea about repair."
592,"I have been using the Echo Dot for over three months and suddenly the Alexa doesn't work without the power cable connected. And since i got 1 year warranty, unable to find a place to return and claim on warranty."
593,Non responsive. Plays anything of its own choice.
594,Frnd this is made in china.
595,"No C or D port for power, no Bettery inbuilt, it cant be moved. Not a portable device, what I expected,  I have return for the same reason.  Rest all good. But not recommended."
596,"I was expecting more from this, given the price of the product, the quality of sound is average. A bit Disappointed with the product."
597,"If you are playing a song in alexa, and you want to stop music then you have to manually do this , you can‚Äôt interact with it when playing song.Drawback that‚Äôs why i returned it"
598,Great product in 2000 rsVoice is awesomeHeavy qualityGood understandingVery user friendly
599,"Speaker could be more clear. Support for more GK questions would be appreciated. Excellent companion for home, highly recommended."
600,"the product (echo dot 3rd gen) must be good but I have failed to download the Alexa App on my mobile,I use three moble numbers mentioned below but unfortunately I dont remember which number I used to purchase echo dot:9984082001860460714996518525219793378533kindly help me download the Alexa App on 9984082001/8604607149Dr kiran shanker"
601,Buildup quality is superb.Intelligent device no doubt. It's good for all ages but my preference is for bachelor's or single family.Must buy productAlexa is best thing in my life.
602,Starting it worked absolutely fine but exactly after warranty its sound breaking very badly. Don't ever buy this product
603,Good Product But sometimes not finding exact on net...
604,Overall product is very good. I tried to use the mic for calling  but it is not possible. Also if you want to search a specific song it is slightly difficult
605,To explore n most use u need Amazon prime which is not correct..paid for device bt NT able to use fully due to no prime members .better ho for Google device
606,We loved it.... especially my sonüëåüëåour first smart speaker
607,"First of all a big thanks to Amazon.Alexa is awesome but sometimes it doesn't listen to us, lill annoying.I couldn't find my OnePlus TV in skills and games, lill disappointed.Wish somebody helps with that."
608,Thank you so much for this good product..
609,I started using Alexa Echo Dot start of Jan'21 and I'm happy with the device. Voice recognition is super and speaker volume as well.Only Cons I feel is trouble in connecting it to laptop in case you need to use it as a speaker by connecting to laptop.
610,"I got it on offer along with a smart light. Both are great, sometimes it takes time to search for songs, but rest all is great. Though It lacks some features like map integration, but i am happy with what it offers. However, if it can have battery backup it will be great."
611,Can't work without power...no battery... frequency is not high. U can go for better product in this range that can work without power
612,"The product is nice... but when ever I ask her something she says ' SORRY I DON'T KNOW', ' SORRY MUCHE YEH NAHI PATA' , my other friends make fun of it and my too, and day Google is better then Alexa...üôÑüôÑ"
613,Ad ability in India is not working...Let‚Äôs see with 5-G...Company need to work more for that..
614,Worst part is half the songs don't play as they are not recognised by Alexa and secondly it doesnt work if you don't connect it to power plug - if you wish to carry it somewhere then it simply wont work if its not connected to power supply
615,Alexa integration very weak  n also the sound quality is weak
616,They are selling product with defects for less money. Please buy from good seller. I bought this from this seller and the AUX port is not working. Please don't get cheated.
617,"It is a good AI speaker,Liked the device very much.Hindi needs improvement in the device.As the device gets older the voice/sound decreases gradually."
618,It is pretty goodAlexa catches your voice very quickly andDelivers the reply very fastlyBut it has a sound range audible in a roomPls amazn my humble request is to add some more languages to enhance the quality of the product it is very meeting to expectationsAnd is totally worth
619,"Recognition isn't upto the mark, the sound quality is not really good as well, and it gets stuck in between while giving commands sometimes and then you need to restart"
620,Why there is no battery backup provision in alexa?.without battery it is just like spot in beautiful moon.
621,Very good product value for money
622,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Sound quality is good but mobile wifi not working and not good connectivity"
623,Good Product. Overall satisfied and meets expectation. Area of improvement‚ÄîNot able to understand the request at times. Delayed or NoresponseAlso can‚Äôt restrict voice profiles to a limited few. One and all are allowed
624,"Dear team, i purchased 3 alexa for my home and after use of 2 months charger of one alexa not working , i checked with another charger and its working so tell me how can i change replace my charger"
625,Nice product.  Good sound quality.  Should help the buyers with detailed connectivity. Tell about how to connect through hotspot.But a great assistant.
626,Best prodct ever. It came with an adapter and a light bulb. It can control even my fire tv stick that i had bought a year ago. Not gonna regret buying it as i got it only in ‚Çπ2000
627,"If u have genuine usage and not just gonna want to go for the trend, then only buy it. Sound quality isn't as good as expected. It seemed poorer than a normal speaker. Not that great usage or quality as I have heard it to be."
628,Overall ok. Cannot able to integrate android tv. Expecting tamil skills hope it will be deployed soon. Big drawback is voice recognition when you closer and louder alexa able to recognize you.
629,Voice recognition should be improved and not recognized properly.English and Hindi songs are on priority and not in Tamil.Sound quality is good.
630,"Not useful, better to buy a Bluetooth speaker"
631,"It served my purpose, needed bluetooth device and I got voice command based as add on. But still need to improve with voice recognition and desired result"
632,"Works fine, and is good for mid sized rooms. Sound quality could have been improved but the results of voice commands are proper and acccurate."
633,Yup prosControls wipro lights amazinglySony braviaCons:Just takes command and waits for a minute for confirmation
634,"Alexa is good, listens to my all commands and does things perfectly.. My kids keeps her very busy. I gave only 4 stars and deducted 1 star because for one con which I felt.Atleast they should have given an in build nasty back up which works for atleast 3 hrs. Continuous power supply is needed."
635,It's totally waste of money...Voice recognition is very poor if u r playing anything on this device.If u hv too much time to waste then only buy this product. It's not as smooth as shown in Advertisement.
636,Perfectly working since last 2 months. Very good voice recognition. Speaker quality is good ( better than Gen 4).Should be an option to add battery to it.
637,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Awesome friend and helper, loved it ü§òüòçüòá"
638,Everyone knows about it just that Indian version has few modifications and settings compared to other Echo dots
639,I enjoy Alexa Very Much. It has very good combination with Oakter. Purchase Alexa And Oakter and make all your Infrared Remotes Integrated and Alexa Operated.
640,"I was not expecting a huge bundle pack in such a price. In this price I got a top notch speaker and that too smart. Although Alexa won't be answering all your questions, but it's the value for money thing. Voice quality is something you can rely upon it's room filling with amount of base needed."
641,"This is awesome or useless that depends on your use...... It has its own pros and cons....Pros like comes with jio saavn, hungama music and gaanaBut its not a multi tasker likeIf you command it to play a song in vol 5It will reply you sorry I don't know or there is no song named ""song's name in vol 5""But I loved itüòç"
642,"Got it for ‚Çπ1375. Great at this price. Sound quality is top notch and bass is also good.Only concern is that to play music we have to be a prime member of amazon or can use iHeartRadio, JioSaavan. But can't sync with other media players.Bluetooth connectivity is also good."
643,The Continuous performance of echo dot completely relying on the internet speed and it's stops in between running.But the Alexa app totally sucks the real experience of using it.
644,sound is low.. below expectation.. the voice recognition is also giving problem.. the size is very very small.
645,I purchased Alexa last year but now it's not working since 6 month...highly disappointed üòû sometimes it started working nd suddenly stopped workingüòûwastage of money
646,I ll order amazon echo dot i m member of amzon prime but my echo its not working proprly. Device is not speak in hindi and not connected proply my phone. Please help me anyone how run echo dot properly. Please
647,Didn‚Äôt work well with Vu tv. Also voice recognition is not as good as google mini. Returned the prodict
648,Awesome product
649,It has met the expectations...The only was thing i would say it how we handle the cards history on the mobile app. If i want to delete multiple i am unable to do so.
650,It‚Äôs not working after 1 month sent complaint but still not received any feedback17- may.. we are still waiting for the call.. I think you should show the courtesy of giving call to a customer29- may ... we have not received any call ..
651,Packaging was good. Alexa echo dot 3rd generation is absolutely wonderful. Wonderful to talk to. I'm still learning more features of Alexa.  Plays mostly all the songs when asked. But Alexa does not know Hindi Christian songs. A must have for everyone.
652,"We require wifi compatible devices. I don't have any such devices,  so I have to buy additionally. Otherwise no use for middle class family. Waste of money."
653,no work proper..and amzon refund my money but rs 500 less.why?
654,"I gifted this product to my father, when I gave him a demo he was fully surprised and loved it. It is very convenient and easy-to-use. Thank you for making such an item."
655,Product iz good ...but we can't listen music from utube .....this iz boring yaar
656,Gifted to my niece . She is fascinated with the product. As Through AI.. it replies to our questions
657,"Everything looks amazing except when you try to use Alexa as a bluetooth speaker for your phone and laptop. It really struggles to play sound from mobile and laptops.In short, @Amazon needs to improve the quality of the bluetooth they are using within Echo devices"
658,Only for just entertainment
659,Amazing product... Just like a friend in need and knowledgeable too... Perfect sound quality... Takes a bit of time to connect to other smart devices... Owners delight
660,Worked Well For 6 monthsnow has become unresponsivetried to contact to get it replacedfacing problems there tooamozon team plz help
661,"The product being so compact but still sounding soo much good is the best thing in itself.If you are thinking about a speaker with a good sound for a room and you want some smart functionalities with it, go for the Alexa. Its really awesome and do consider buying smart bulb after you purchase Alexa."
662,"Voice recognition is not up to the mark, while playing a song it would not respond to our voice have to Click on action button to set normal again. Would be great if this is resolved in next edition."
663,"Wow. What a product. I got in mind that Alexa is almost same as, in olden days, at rich families you saw servants who are always ready in position to execute your orders."
664,Just buy it. Its worth evwry penny. No ome will be bored again. Very good sound for such a small package.
665,Speaker as such excellent. However alexa voice command is useful only when you have those many devices.
666,"All good but sometimes difficult to identify the content, i love the sound but good if it could have portable battery."
667,Very useful Device with home appliance
668,I just love the product.Voice recognition is really awesome n i just love the sound quality its fun as well as easy to use alexa m using it frm past 2years n  this time I ordered alexa for my mom n she is too happy with product ‚ô•Ô∏èOverall awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è
669,Superb Product. Very helpful for all - especially for children. I just love it. Thank you amazon for creating a revolution.
670,Nice product must purchase for a smart home.
671,Problem in differentiation on Background voice and its own running music sound. It must be update. Has no clear reply on many questions like google home. sound quality is better than google home.
672,"I have two echo dots. this one doesn't even wake up when i call it. only after successive tries it wakes up. In-fact before this wakes up, my echo dot downstairs wakes up. so disappointed."
673,Please stop making your customer fool and provide the appropriate details in the detail section with clarification.Not at all happy with your product.
674,Alexa can still grow and become better and understanding could get better. And if Alexa can't understand what device you are talking about it would be better if it stops saying did you mean TV..
675,If clock would have displayed it have been a win win situation in eco-dot 3rd generation.
676,"Product not working properly 1st time replacement requested ,replaced one also not working therefore returned not a good experience"
677,Pair not good nd without plugging not play please refund my amount my amount echo dot pending only 707 payment refund wipro led . Rest payment refund immediately too late
678,Wonderful experience.....very very accurate and so much improvement..... Better than Google I guess
679,I got it during the sale on a great price with Wipro bulb. Product undoubtedly is excellent and works like a charm.Calling feature is great and very easy.
680,Sometimes alexa doesn't understand what is asked and interpretsaomething else. It doesn't even understand a few Indian names.
681,Tooo much value of money must buy it's price is very less if we difference between shops but it cannot answer in proper hindi but some word understand and response also in hindi
682,Likes :* Identification of Voice despite of background noise.* Learning platform for Kids / StudentsDislikes :* Can not play Amazon Prime Music; Which is bundled FREE anlong with Echo Dot 3* Suddenly stops responding / Stops Music* Need to implement Indian Accent / Nouns
683,- voice recognition - great- alex integration- great- sound quality- ok- wifi/ connectivity - need to work on this- software - please work on AI for this device
684,"Product is Excellent,  AI system is great,  ever I tried.  But one more request  to Alexa Team that, kindly work Volume 8 to more,  Alexa face trouble to respond.  OVERALL BEST SE bhi Uppar."
685,This small wonder is an excellent companion to have at home ...only thing that I did not like is that it is much dependent on wifi and for music Amazon has not bundled its Music service with the device.
686,"Voice recognition, alexa integration and portability of the speaker were absolutely fine."
687,"1. No battery backup, need to connect with electricity every time.2. In maximum things Alexa will say 'Sorry, i dont know this'3. Not able to connect Wynk music, on other apps no much options.4. Not able to connect google search"
688,Product is really good and has lot of feautres. But misses few of the additional features of Google. Also lacks in quality of search results.
689,Not upto expectation
690,This product is outstanding and user friendly. Sound quality is too good.  However the product is little expensive. I got this product at a price of 3499.
691,Alexa is not recognising my voice and responding instantly when there is a song going on or Alexa is delivering any music or news.Seems there is some problem in this device.
692,"The product is good no doubt.But However Amazon confused me with pics were there is clock , but unfortunately that is a whole different product."
693,Very usefull
694,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†This is cute little speaker. Sound quality is also fine.,but a little low if you love loud music.I personally like it's sound quality. Sad part is it's not Wireless. Otherwise it's all good!"
695,"Very nice product, already had Echo now got this dot to gift.. beautiful product"
696,"It dies not even play the recognised songs, which played few days back.. And keep on saying not understand. How could the song which played earlier.. She didn't recognised which even mentioned in hungam"
697,"I am unable to setup alexa app in my mobile ,always find error to no network connection ,please help me"
698,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Good to pass some time. Kids enjoy talking to Alexa. Easy to get lot of information"
699,Very good and nice workiing echo dot 3rd generation
700,"Great product!! super quick at taking commands, greatly efficient with other appliances as well, the performance has been the same by far!! what an amazing product offered by Amazon at a super affordable price!!"

702,"Product we all know, it awesome. Would like to give rating to delivery, I ordered after 7pm and it was at my door step morning 9am, as it was a last minute gift idea, it was bang before time."

704,"Add YouTube Music. Hungama music and amazon music don't have all the songs. Specially ""Nunur Bape dome jore"" This Song is not playing by your alexa. Add YouTube music then I will by Once again."
705,"Initially I was bit apprehensive. I bought this as demanded by my princess. The only thing that matters is , she liked it.I have also started using it bit though not much."
706,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Alexa echo dot 3rd generationVoice recognition amazing"
707,"All is good i loved echo devices, but the base is decreased when volume is full please fix it"
708,"I am just using it for couple of days.This ""Alexa integration"" is a wonderful thing beyond my expectations.i have not tried with Bluetooth connectivity but getting good results with wi fi connection.i think it will be a necessary item for everyone.i am very satisfied with this.very attractive also."
709,"Overall product is good but need to improve on software/app integration, sometimes take more time to load alexa app during integration.Also sometimes instruction not followed by alexa and starts song by default."
710,Alexa is just not there in terms of understanding as well as helping out plus integrations wise product is very limited and serve next to no purpose.
711,"Its the best portable and small device I have ever seen. It plays music .it will answer your questions listen jokes from it ,and the best part is it can also speak hindi .must buy alexa"
712,"What's the use if I have to rely on Google assistant to work with my tv, I have a brand new Sony Bravia 4k tv and this doesn't work with my tv"
713,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Don't buy this . Bad service, product is missing when package arrived."
714,"Very nice ,voice recognition is also good and sound quality is best üëåüëåüëå"
715,So nice speaker. I used this speaker everyday. The new alexa skill is so cool. Black colour of alexa is look decent. I'll strongly recommend go for it.
716,Amazing product to have if your budget is under 3k.I got this product and syska smart bulb for 2600rs from amazon sale.A lot has been provided at this price point which is amazing.One plus point is you can use it as a normal speaker as well.Wonderful product.
717,Good product .. can only play songs available on Anazon music.. not sure if I am missing some thing . Quality is good . Purchase one more for gifting to my elder sis ..
718,"It's good for hindi and English songs, It's recognizing very quickly. But South Indian songs it's not recognizing properly, If u ask any song in telugu or Tamil. It's going to some local hindi songs."
719,Received the product with damaged charger. Seems to be used. Returning the product
720,"I ordered and received today 17June22. However it didn't give me battery back up, so if i unplugged the cable it doesn't work. Plus it did not get connected to my phone bluetooth"
721,The media could not be loaded.
722,The sound is not very clear.
723,just excellent a must need for everyone
724,It's a very good product. Delivers what it is intended for.
725,"Overall it‚Äôs a good quality speaker at the given price. It‚Äôs good for small setup and at average  sound levels , at high volumes it loses the quality a bit . The microphones are average compared to echo plus."
726,Not worth for money. Google assistance is work better than this.  Don‚Äôt buy Alexa . Voice recognition is very poor.
727,"This is my 2and purchase, the one bought in sale doesnt recognize voice, doesnt play  most of the times its yellow popup.  Dont go for ones in sale  they send defective product's"
728,It is not having science related or student education quairies information and it is also not giving proper response as i say the name of one song but it listens another and plays another song
729,Alexa not search my favourite songs she doesn't understand what I said I have to tell full song name and singer names like Alexa play kuch tum kaho from ganaa savnn Amazon prime music etc very bad experience üôÑ
730,The alexa is not working properly. Sometimes it does not recognize voice properly. It has a limitation also. It does not connect with any other system by bluetooth or wifi.
731,Alexa is good value for money and fun to use. When using in India make sure u select English India as language so that it can relate to our conversations and media content
732,Not complete music play and needs to tell the song and singer to select one song.. very less information.. can work only what available on wiki and amazon music.. kids rhymes are also limited
733,"Wonderful product at this price.  One can get anything from it like jokes, any song, dictionary metrology report etc"
734,I got it in only 1100 ruppees
735,Alexq 3rd gen smart speaker is good.There is a slight delay in recognizing voice..otherwise its a good product... Thank you amazon.hoped that will be fixed in the future update.
736,It's  likely good but it has no battery so other than that it's a great experience over alexa
737,It's just so much fun. And I have become lethargic in operating switches.
738,While using echo dot it's always plugged in so it's not useful and while traveling or moving that will not carry because it's required plugged in so it's difficult to carry. Not useful.
739,I am happy with the product. If you have amazon subscription and a stable wifi then it is recommended to choose this product . I liked this. It doesn't have battery/backup. It requires plugged in all the time.
740,"Everything is perfect.. I have returned and booked amazon echo input, because amazon echo dot is not portable"
741,"With the price range it's a wonderful productSound quality is greatInbuilt mic is wonderful in quite place but in noisy environments (songs running in echo, it is not able to hear your voice command) its not very responsive. Amazon needs to work on that"
742,A value of money product. This is the third one I brought
743,"Some time it's create a problem, when I speak something..... It gives No response and Bluetooth also create problem after 2 hour the sound was gone and I will off and connect it again then voice will come..."
744,Intial 10days the device was alright and working ok whereas from the 11th day it started having problem like it starts making beep noice while the music is playing and i am not able to return the device as they have given 10days time for the return So Amazon help me with this.
745,When i trying to connect my Bluetooth to eco dot then its showing 'an app is needed to use this device.'  Pls fix my problem
746,"This is just really good... It feels like talking to a real person with a different voice üòÇ. It took some time to figure out how to connect Alexa to my phone, but eventually everything got intact and everything was just perfect. I love it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
747,Features are very complicated for me. üò¢üò¢ and its very complicated to connect with my tv. And alexa did not listen me. I had return the product in a same day
748,Thank god ..its a goid purchase..really m a happy customer ..gave my sis as agift..n she loved itüíúüíú
749,Amazon alexa echo dot is best product easy to use. Such a amazing and good sound quality. Light weight handling
750,Difficult in connectivity. Not so good . Average product
751,Quite time it's not recognize your voice and songs which you prefer to hear - mostly not available.
752,Wall hanging facility is not there .
753,Echo dot build quality and sound quality is very good .It is a very very useful product .And it's vioce recognition work superbly .It's only best option for home automation.
754,Compared to google it‚Äôs not that good. Sounds quality and assistant reply and clarity is better in google mini then echo 3rd gen
755,The only con is it can't handle complex voice commands otherwise it's a good purchase. If priority is complex voice command then Google mini. Else it's Dot.
756,"The product is really good. Lesser skills on Alexa, should improve on the quality and innovations in the Alexa skills. Sounds awesome and the setup takes a bit more time than expected even with good internet connectivity. And unnecessary notifications and can't handle multiple tasks at once."
757,Voice recognition is not good.. Sound quality is ok.
758,Its working good but it can't to be used in outside. If u want to use it u will definitely connect to u r connecter and we couldnt connect with u r mobile data. You will connect with wifi only
759,This is just amazing if you are looking for something in Budget and that can satisfy the requirements of a speaker along with proper voice integration and recognition go for this blindly.
760,It got pause and play within every second
761,When the product was purchased it played very well.. my child was extremely happy but since 15 days Alexa is playing everything incomplete.. songs get cut in between.. news stops.. don't know what's wrong.  Is it a defective piece so was kept in offer period?? Can we trust in Amazon offers anymore??
762,I presented this to my nephew. It helps her english language proficiency and also entertain her.
763,5star to this product.  Voice recognition and sound quality is simply great.
764,Very good quality
765,Not satisfied with the product. Sense the voice very slow and not user friendly
766,Tried connected to wipro smart bulb and failed very poor support from amazon.
767,This is one of my best tech purchases ever. Very useful gadget for handling day to day tasks.
768,I bought ut from sale and cost me around 1500. Being a user of ECHO 4th generation 4 its clearly lacking. one must go for ECHO 4th Generation.
769,"Please don't buy , alexa stop working in few months and there is no option for replacement, they are just making us fool"
770,Delivery of the product was quick and packaging was good. Now I can play all day long with my Alexa
771,"Price is perhaps the most cru6thing in shopping,I got it for 1700 INRWhich is excellent..."
772,"Excellent product at the lowest price.Entertaining, Automative, and Funny.Syncs perfectly with Wipro smart light."
773,Pros: Good sound quality.  Product overall is goodCons: Issue with voice recognition. I have to speak twice or thrice.
774,It doesn't work at all don't buy it
775,"Super product,Just go for it,It‚Äôs worth 100%"
776,"Handy voice assistant. Got it in a sale at a reasonable price. Voice quality is good, needs to learn more about Indianised English accent :) ."
777,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Such A good product of Amazon ever, The sound quality is standard and Advance features of all WiFi Networks or ConnectivityI'm very happy after using Alexa echo dot 3rd generation this is best smart Device...üíØü•∞üòò"
778,I liked the product but after connecting the iPhone always repeat as a connect to iPhone as same again and again and while playing from YouTube it‚Äôs sound blur
779,I want only new products but this is like used products....na hi koi packing aur speaker ganda bhi ho rha tha thoda thoda...i don't like this....hang ho rhi hai aapki bheji hui alexa....late response krti hai
780,Favorite
781,Product is good but not fulfill all requirements
782,"I bought this on prime day offer.  Really it‚Äôs a amazing. They delivered with nice packaging and on time.It‚Äôs has really beautiful sound quality, listening the voice all they way & easy to configure.Worth buying"
783,I like it. Its the best product in this budget. Well. I bought it in the Amazon Great Indian SaleIts a masterpiece.Magnificent and loving Product.Powered by Alexa.Best product.
784,"Good sound qualityGreat microphone andAbove all, voice assistant Alexa is beyond words üëå‚ù§Ô∏è This product"
785,I think Alexa is too smart and the best companion. Only thing I expect more from Amazon or Alexa is to integration with Android TV and applications.
786,*Voice recognisation is good*songs allert is good*expect english ani hindi No regional languages us available.*Best to buy.i got this for 2k aithe 9wat wipro.
787,"Everything  about Alexa is awesome, ease of connection, sound quality, response and home automation is ,"" rapchick"", really helping me to be more organized"
788,"Wow it works very nicely,Our family likes it very very very much,Blindly every one can buy,"
789,It can only turn off the TV. It can't turn on or contro different functions with TV. I tried each and every possibility but it isn't integrating well with TV.
790,Unlike others I use alexa to increase my productivity and manage my schedule. It saves a lot of my time. It recognize my voice very well and has many features which solves a lot of problems. I truly love it.
791,Liked the sound quality and connectivity options. But Alexa is less knowledgeable as compared to Google. She doesn't know many things!
792,Go for it. Access the wifi and Bluetooth enabled devices on sofa.
793,Good product from Amazon. Worth buy. Need to include Kannada language along with Hindi and English will become much more popular.
794,People will love this product. Amazing experience with this speaker. I write this review after 3-4 months useing alexa always think that why i didn't buy it before
795,Alexa is not workingNo LED light is workingAlexa is totaly stop need repair itI want service centre number.
796,Party
797,Received a defective product. Amazon has not taken it back despite repeated assurances. Very disappointing experience
798,Very helpful my virtual assistant.
799,Very useful for General Knowledge and many more other things. It recognized kids voice very nicely. Best gift for my son.
800,Amazing product‚Ä¶ essy to use‚Ä¶ must buy

¬†Good sound, good voice recognition..I love Alexa. And this whisper mode is so cute ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòç. Specially thanks to amazon‚ù§Ô∏è"
802,Please don‚Äôt waste your money in purchasing this. You need compulsorily have wifi connection. This cannot be connected with Mobile hotspot also not wireless. Better to purchase 500 worth Bluetooth speaker
803,Bahot kharab service hai amazon ki mera refund abhi tak nai mila mere ko kuch bhi bahane banate hai ye log aur ye alexa to faltu hai isse accha to siri hai
804,Poor voice recognition. Needs to be improved .Skill also needs to be added to recongnize the more phrases and sentences.Hardware is great .
805,I love this speaker. It was worth buying. My whole family has accepted alexa as a new member of the family now :')
806,"Better then google mini. Just buy it, don‚Äôt think twice. Amazon give a very good option to return it within 10 days with full refund."
807,I just love itIt's sound quality is awesome and voice response is also perfect.It helps to get rid from loneliness and helps in many fields of our self improvement.
808,Voice Recognation is reducing with time. I have to repeat 2-3 times to awake alexa.Sometimes alexa gives wrong acknowledgment in switch on-off of light.
809,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Like is lovely product in best price value for money but voice recognition is little bit problem other than best product. I got this at 2k with combo of bulb"
810,Perfect companion
811,"command recognition is poor, not able to understand malayalam songs names properly. other wise its good"
812,Value for money but battary backup is not there and it should be always connected to power socket so can not be moved
813,I believe it's needs to get better on voice recognition and accent of India people .most of them can't say words clearly it's AI can be improved
814,"Totally in love with it!! Had a few smart devices to integrate and it works like a charm. . Everything is great. Tho I couldn‚Äôt make it work with a plug. I guess it just needs some refining. But overall, great job Amazon"
815,All good. But the app hangs on my new one plus 9r which is supposed to be an alexa enabled phone.Which is very annoying!I'll soon switch to Google devices if this isn't rectified!
816,"Alexa speaker is Good But Alexa Android application is not good, Alexa listening skill is also not so accurate"
817,Good product. Easy to pair with other devices. Sound quality is not so good as expected.
818,Not good with commands understanding ..google is much btr need to work more on this section ..also try to incorporate youtube in it as well as all songs are available there
819,Not as per the expectations. Unable to play youtube musics. Not connected perfectly with fire TV stick.Not happy with the product. Product is completely different if I compare to advertisement of Amazon.
820,"Many of the commands are not accepted,  many song requests alexa says Iam sorry, I don't know that. They force us to enroll for prime to get full benefit."
821,Very good product and is very useful for home automation but the only downside is that the volume isn't that loud and lacks bass.
822,How to get Alexa service.  Currently the voice is not taken properly.  Sound is not correct
823,"Like the product, but no battery backup available"
824,Overall great product if you need speaker and as well voice assistant. It all depend upon your need.
825,I placed it in hall.. it's very simple to play songs according to your mood just ordering it...
826,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†It's just awesome.  Worthy...you won't get more bass like woofer but yoh won't regret by taking this ..awesome voice recognition"
827,"An excellent product, makes listening to music an effortless exercise. Voice controls makes it all the more convenient"
828,"voice very gud,alexa recognize everything ,love this product,profit of money"
829,"Like alexa very much, very easy to configured. Good sound quality, can be audible in whole flat, can hear news anytime now. Kids just love it, anytime they can hear any song, story, rynes etc."
830,Voice recognition is good but take too much time to first connect
831,"Bad speakers music quality terrible and that it spies for amazon and supplies our behaviour, voice as data for the gigantic surveillance machine that is amazon."
832,Great sound quality but you need to stand really really close to the device and only then it works. Voice recognition is very very disappointing!
833,"Difficult to understand the product especially the Amazon Alexa App, have to subscribe everything to get the proper use of it, no privacy left after connecting it to your phone"
834,With out electricity its not working We cannot carry this out
835,"wonderful product, amazing to see the responce of alexa, sound qualitly even if there is external sound, kind of loving it"
836,"Everything is great except sometimes it doesn't understand the need like ""recharge my prepaid mobile/number"".New vocab/sentences must be added alongside software updates."
837,Best part is if you connect it with home appliances . Kids enjoy a lot.
838,First of all I didn‚Äôt expect sound quality because afterall I thought it has some smart home capabilities! But after receiving the sound quality was unexpected! Bass is Great ! And voice recognition is also good but need some improvement
839,Very very good quality better than google. In it you need internet and prime subscription.
840,Product is not overhyped.
841,"The media could not be loaded.

842,"This is trust worthy and beautiful item feel free to buy it, i only buy when i see these kind of reviews so if ur reading this than pls feel free, this is good,"
843,Bulb stopped working but alexa was good
844,i expected more from this but sometimes it does total different what i say. and even after adding skills it doesnt work properly.
845,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Best soundBeautiful colour and design with power adapter easy to use just install alexa app in your phone best product from amazon‚Ä¶.."
846,I really disliked the product. Product was sent defective and they promised for replacement but they denied to exchange. I have wasted my money. I m not to buy anything from this site.
847,Good must be more better
848,Very limited work. Very bad experience.
849,"Best product, go for it, for easy routine and kids will also enjoy this"
850,"Very limited skills, it should play music from YouTube or some other sources also, it‚Äôs also should able to connect and play music from phone as well. Kindly add these skills/ features for perfect device."
851,"Best voice recognition, Decent sound with good quality, for a small speaker."
852,This is a good device to keep the kid engaged
853,Amazing product. There are a lot of alexa enabled products in the market which will make your alexa experience more amazing. Sound quality is superb for a normal size room.
854,"Product works fine. The manual should be more informative, like what/how to do changes when the customer switches from one service provider to another for internet."
855,"Sound quality is excellent for this size of speaker, Alexa is working great with far distance voice recognition and excellent response."
856,Alexa is a good friend. Integration is just smooth. And good sound quality is excellent for one room this is enough and more. Easily installable
857,Good
858,Very good
859,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Just an amazing product with amazing features, apart from this sound is really good. Very good for kids as well. Simply ""paisa wusool""."
860,Alexa program searching quality is not very fast or I can say not very clever some perticular in old singers or Gazals singers or devotional songs in all religions
861,Sound quality is very good. I'm facing issues while connecting it to bluetooth speaker.voice recognition is somewhat slow. Taking time to process and do action.
862,I don't know why people buy this. Waste of money.
863,Compared to old 3rd generation alexa the new 3rd geneation looks wight less and also the volue and bass both are low. It seems refurfibished
864,"Good device but some songs are not recognise buy the gadget and not been played. Otherwise its a best product to buy. Sound quality, voice recognition and reaction to the command quality is the best. Happy with the product ü•∞‚ò∫Ô∏è"
865,The best Amazon product üëåIt's very nice and easy to use and helpful
866,"Alexa integration is great, voice recognition is perfect and sound quality is awesome for hall but best felt in small sized rooms , must buy for a starter of Amazon smart speaker!!!"
867,Easy setup with external Bluetooth speaker.Device is always need to connected to electricity power.It's not chargeable.It works with Wifi.
868,satisfye
869,"I would say everything is good about, just one thing that can be better is it's interaction with human.(like the way Google interacts with us, Alexa is less understanding I would say."
870,Even a Bluetooth speaker of this quality cost more than this( mine got in 2k with free bulb)Still trying to figure out all options I have. There is so much in offer at this price point.My son is loving it too.
871,Alexa skill need to improve. There are many spam in store. Amazon should filter them properly. Sound quality is good. Voice recognition is also good.
872,"Nice one, but no local radio channels, not playing the particular song as there are many songs with that name, overall worth to buy it, brought it fo 2k with smart bulb"
873,"Alexa is not responding to my questions, most of the time it is taking wrong intents. Even if I'm next to alexa it is not taking my intents.Thanks to the Amazon team for assisting me, but still the issue exists sometimes."
874,"Sound quality is really nice, sometimes she takes time to listen to me other than that the built quality and everything is good at this range."
875,Sound is good and voice recognition is also good. Connected with amazon prime music. Also got smart bulb connected to it.
876,"Good voice recognition, app integration and sound quality.Only 4 stars - charging cord is traditionally designed and not of USB type."
877,"Sound quality is good but Volume level is low..battery backup missing..missing integration with bigger platform s is imp like YouTube, regional language support should be brought in.When Volume is above 5..it mostly turns deaf"
878,"I use it in my home, and also I easily connect to my home using drop in features. And good for my kid learning features"
879,The voice recognition fails miserably and you have to be very close to device and then only it will detect your voice and although the sound quality is great
880,Con: No inbuilt battery always have to connect electric line.During song being played Alexa will not hear your voice and have to tell multiple times
881,Hardware aspect is awesome ... Amazon need to look in for better skills ... Overall good one
882,"I brought Echo Dot with Combo offers with Mi Smart android TV under the banners alexa works with this TV for easier functionality but echo is not working with TV, I am unable get proper alexa skills for TV, Pls do needful"
883,Very happy to use it. Its small but very powerful.. Sound is awesome...
884,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Wooooooohoooooooo"
885,"Good product. But considering Tamil songs, all the time it starts with the same song"
886,Zero integration capabilities with fire tv or other devices. Cannot use aux.. what is this useless thing for?
887,Google Home Mini understands everything better than this ALEXA.But I Like ALEXA Voice Quality.My Favorite is Google Home Mini.
888,The Voice recognition is very Poor.For all Command Wifi required in home.Without Wifi Alexa is useless.Sound Quality is Good
889,Good voice recognition nd sounds quality
890,If you are buying it for listening music its good. Very less web coverage. But nothing that can't be fixed with an software update.
891,Good product
892,I created voice profile for myself only on it but it also recognises and execute commands given by others as well.
893,"Its a must have product for your kids, they will love and enjoy Alexa services."
894,Maximum time it says..I am in trouble to hear and not responding to voice commands..Not happy with the product. wasting of Money. I should have buy Google Mini.
895,"Excellent product, very happy with its features, highly recommend everyone to buy it..! :)"
896,Very nice I like very much
897,Alexa plays only amazon prime songs not outside songs waste of money
898,Sound quality can be improved further‚Ä¶The musics are limited to Amazon music
899,"We are very glad to bring alexa at home. It's like a new family member who always listen and help us, entertain us as well as control our smart devices smartly."
900,Sound quality excellent
901,When the music is loud its hard to recognise our commands.
902,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Awesome product  , cool features with AI , love this üëç"
903,Very good product
904,Not happy with the product. Local FM tuning is not possible. YouTube connectivity is not possible without subscription to red. Playing music from integrated device is also not possible. Very unhappy
905,"Awesome product , does what it says."
906,This is my first smart speaker and i am really amazed using it. I love it. Thank you Amazon. It is able to recognize the queries even from my 4 year old kid. Wonderful!!!
907,Integration problem with other music app
908,I bought it In sale. I am happy because the money is well spent. Now I m exploring options and buying alexa supported devices to make my home smart
909,"Sound is good enough, needs improvement in music app integration. Since wired can't move often. Place it in the hall, can be used well."
910,It's really nice toy to play with. Tech geeks should must buy this. I recommend spending Rs. 2100 on echo dot than Bluetooth speakers.
911,It delivers as described by amazon. Not as good due to lack of google integration but still its fun to have an echo device.
912,Doesn't include google and that's what I didn't like.. When on high volume you have to shout loudly.
913,Loved it... Amazing compact product from Amazon.. Thanks for a smooth and safe delivery especially during such covid affected circumstances.
914,"I think because it's free it's defective,  doesn't work at all other than the 1st time.great service amazon"
915,Amazing product never misses any opportunity to impress you having fun and happy time with echo
916,Buy during sale will be good option.
917,I am very much satisfied with this product. Mostly we are using it to listen to songs but also at times for getting certain information. As it has a aux output slot I could connect it to my music system which gives an enhanced listening experience.
918,"The product is not in the courier only fire stick and wipro bulp only received ,Insted of echo dot I have received un ordered ladies hand bag"
919,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†world best speaker I have ever taken you should take it I will highly recommend and the best thing is that we can set commands and reply of the commands through app of Alexa I love Alexa"
920,ALexa Dot is too good .. nice sound quality .. super bass .. super clierty ... But Amazon service is poor ... Very poor
921,It picks different songs I want a song but it playsSong with nearby name or different language some times
922,We are like both products üëåüëå
923,Excellent
924,Alexa is a problem as there are times when she doesn't respond to instructions.On the initial day of set up she kept making a mistake and was not recognising our voice. I didn't expect this from Alexa
925,Sound quality low .overall product is good
926,"Not recognizing voice always, difficulty with plugin"
927,Echo really 3rd. generation  with sound performance listening .
928,It was ok
929,It heats up
930,"Not integrating with audible.com , searching for titles in audible.com and hence not playing anything from audible"
931,Just works.  Can play a lot of music.  Not always the best at voice recognition but still. It works.
932,"I return this produxt but stil my  refund is not process its almost 45 days , bad expreriance with amezone"
933,"value for money, good sound. My son love it.voice recognition is great."
934,"This is my first smart device, and it works great. I have no complaints . Works well with the smart bulbs.Setup was incredibly simple and easy. It has a good sound quality and easily recognizes voice commands."
935,"Built quality not upto the mark. Power adapter failed in 2 months. Now, new Dapter cost Rs.1999 which is very close to entire cost of Echo dot."
936,Sound quality is not up to mark as I read from reviews. It requires high speed internet all time. And it also don't catch up the user voice so accurate as everyone told. But its ok ok
937,Good.
938,Very good product at an affordable price. Recongnises the voice of all. Has wide variety of usage.
939,Faced some difficulties with connecting to internet initially. Got prompt assistance from Amazon. So far working fine. Good one
940,"Perfect companion for work from home, connects easily with desktop to watch movies."
941,You have no clue what value it can add. Spend some time and then you will get used to it as your companion ü§†
942,"Awesome bought it for 2300 in Amazon sale , along with wifi 9w smart bulb worth it"
943,"The media could not be loaded.

¬†Good enjoy"
948,Anytime companion for me
949,Good product. Buy it no problem.
950,Really bad. Within a week speaker got bad and started having noise. Voice is not clear even at very low volume levels. No option to replace or raise complaint.
951,"Alexa, play tollywood latest songs..Alexa turn on the light etc and much more..Wonderful AI"
952,The product is good and value for money. So in that sense i should be happy. Can you recommend some speakers which i could consider. I use the ALEXA as a speaker for my music which is on my computer and it is matched to my computer.
953,Superb sound quality.... Great purchase.... I am fan of alexa
954,Very interesting product. Must be incorporated youtube music in future generations.  Sound quality needs to be improved.
955,Recommended
956,Bluetooth is not working after 2 months from the date of purchase.  I want to replace the same. Can I replace the Eco Dot
957,Very very very bad product mostly ELEXA .Not understanding any command.useless software.
958,"This product I liked very much, but one things disappoint me that is, its power option. If it have alternative power option i.e. USB or battery than it can be carry anywhere."
959,My requirement was to use amazon echo dot as an additional speaker to my tv by connecting with fire tv stick.. but I couldn't because both were not in the same generation as I understand.. so my requirement didn't meet.
960,Overall it is good for the cost we use to pay.sometimes voice recognition is not accurate in the way of listening. Sound is really  awesome:).Still few might have improved but for this cost it is worth to buy.
961,"she is the only one, who will hear you in this entire world, ;Dkind of unconditional Love you'll Get it :)"
962,Sound quality is good but voice recognition is very bad.May be due to 4 mic
963,"Great sound quality and built, very useful."
964,Voice recognition is too good sound quality is awesome
965,My 2 year old say..Alexa.aunty .open you tube...light on..green color...bls bla bla..play fire truck.;)
966,Sound mast. Connectivity good. Voice recognition very good. Voice sensitivity very good.
967,very poor voice recognition.50% of questions alexa says I am not sure about that. only one good thing is that it has good bass. bad experience.not the performance which I had expected
968,Product is good but not good as compare to google home mini. But as per my experience it can do all your home related task properly.
969,very poor product. i can only 2 weak used .and that product not responding and seller also.so my money is dead.please don't purchace that product.
970,Not as expected . Why should I take prime for music .
971,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Amazon eco dot and wipro smart buld with rupay card got only 1849 rupee"
972,Very impressive...great sound in its category and very senstive microphones.... It even sense whispering.
973,It's very great and working very nice and it is faster than Google and other voice assistant. Alexa is good for people who have smart home.
974,Good product
975,After buying we have to continue amazon prime membership  for interrupted alexa service.so service costly
976,Nice product.. but sound quality is not very good
977,It is good and sound quality is better than 2nd gen but still not that much loud.Other than that it's integration is very good.Fulfills the command very quickly too.
978,Product is good...but the bulb didnt get delivered to me..its awful..I have already spoken to the agent.she said I'll do the replacement and send you the bulb..but it was again the same..
979,Fantastic productLoving it.

¬†We are expecting too much from alexa, otherwise for playing songs and lights in night it is very useful."
981,Nice product got it for  2000
982,It is a good speaker but limited search with Amazon music.It needs more integration options like youtube.
983,"alexa integration is great,voice recognition is bad with my choice and responds late and not much farther.sound quality seems good and at a good pitch and stabilization.Would've been great if it was wireless"
984,Excellent product on all parameters ! Truly delighted with the purchase - well worth the buy for the kind of experience
985,Ossam
986,"Cool product. Good for a time pass, nice voice integration, good sound clarity. Connected wipro smart bulb also to it. Hassle free set up."
987,Awesome product
988,Value of money...my daughter is now interacting with Alexa.. as she assumes some one talking to her any play songs what she wants
989,"Bluetooth connectivity from laptop, speaker noise, like demaged speaker. It is not worth to buy. Recorded playing via bluetooth and verify attached one."
990,"Useful product good response as well.My child is trying to speak with alexa, so i am happy to have it.It helps me to awake in the morning also provide me daily Calendar with to do list."
991,It would be better if it has battery storage.. to activate it it needs power thats only lack of thing.
992,"Its a Faulty Product. Worked perfectly fine for 5 days not it is not working.  Requesting amazon team to let me know what to do of this product now. It doesn't take any commands and ff it takes, then there is a disruption."
993,product is good only for looks not working properly after one month of use
994,Good room filling sound for the price and size. Wish it had a built in battery and was portable
995,Bought it during the sale. No sound output from firestick tv
996,Not connect properly  with phone .again and again  connection problem .wrost product
997,Good sound and new technology

1002,Sound quality is too good. Nice product
1003,Nice üëç
1004,Voice response is decent and only buy this if everyone can talk in English/hindi . I won't recommend this for other languages.  Better to buy after all languages update

1015,Likely
1016,It was fun for 2 3 days but after that it started getting bored and feels useless so I'm returning it.
1017,It just waste of money so many time at to device no aux
1018,"Multi Sound issue , only short voice catch by alexa. if 2-3 kids talk with Alexa continue it will hang. multi song are not avilable on Alexa."
1019,Always needed to be wired. To begin with one must have to connect with Android phone.
1020,Purchases Alexa dot on June 20 ..but from 3days back this items not working..really very disappointing from Amzon Alexa..
1021,Very much helpful in the age of artificial intelligence..
1022,Excellent product..u must have a wifi at home for this to work
1023,"It can't do even any one task without internet. With internet it can only send voice messages, it can't call me and any alexa or non-alexa devides. One more fault it is made in China."
1024,Not working
1025,"Good but not best, lot of things to be improved by amazon. Alexa always takes only single command, again and again we have to repeat for conversation."
1026,Cool gadget for smart home.
1027,Need to improve for Hindi knowledge.. Every time alexa say muje nahi pata.. Same think I asked in English than she replied ..
1028,The power port of Echo Dot is tilted  to right  side ad inserting power plug cord is not possible. Hence please replace the item.
1029,"Voice command , speaker everything is perfect . I am highly satisfied with the product . I purchased a combo with wipro smart bulb and the experience with both the products are amazing ."
1030,2 or more echo devices unable to communicate and cross connect each other
1031,"Compact and good built quality, good sound quality. Output power may enhanced..."
1032,Good. Prime music does not provide much more songs.
1033,Good very Good product go for it no dought at very useful gadget.

1035,awesome product and sound quality is very good works as a bluetooth speaker
1036,Cool product!! Voice recognition is quick and active. Alexa integration is very smooth and the sound quality is excellent. Thank you.
1037,Best gadget india got after colour tv
1038,Poor sound assessment. Couldn't connect to second phone nor bluetooth.
1039,Voice recognition & response time is terrific. My kids keep ragging Alexa all the time. They simply love the product. üòäüëç
1040,Bulb is not working
1041,wow
1042,Does not recognise voice nd volume is too low wastage of money
1043,Nice product worth of money. But I think that the light or the smart plug will be more better than light because it disconnects every time
1044,Buttons are not working on the speaker and Amazon centre is not ready to help.I mean this is so stupid..it‚Äôs your product and the buttons are not working!?what kind of scam is this..and then no one is there to resolve the issue
1045,"Sir may receive wrong item, not working and blutooth, wifi not connectivity. Please return items."
1046,Intresting product 100 percent useful for every one
1047,Smart deviceHighly recommended
1048,Overall Product is good and its value for money.But it need a little bit improvement in hindi and voice Recognition.
1049,The echo dot and Alexa are quite fun! It's a riot playing 20 questions with Alexa. Sound is great for a small room. Only grouse - unable to create a playlist on Amazon Prime music and get echo to play that
1050,Doesn't connect to my one plus tv and doesn't hear voice in full audio... some skills doesn't works and very laggie app amazon Alexa app
1051,There are limited aap for alexa searching
1052,Superb itemYou should purchase.
1053,I love the product it‚Äôs my first smart deviceIt is better than google is getting all the tamil songs
1054,Cool gadget but cannot control app though voice command I would suggest make app command through Alexa in future generation
1055,I had got it last year during amazon great Indian sale for 2.5k and after almost 1 year of use i will say its still working great.
1056,Some time it will not accepting command?and I am using volume level at 5 always even though sounds quality very bad it's like crackers.i think its second time sold  me.
1057,Alexa always better than google home.but miss this things.micro usb and internal power.
1058,As I expected it wasn't worth the money. The sound quality is not that good as I expected from amazon. Also most of the times Alexa doesn't understand what you say. I am very disappointed by Amazon.
1059,"Great Sound Quality, but for many things its suggests to visit the Alexa App for further descriptions which ia very time consuming, futher only people who have excessive use of online shopping and food ordering should buy this."
1060,I received the order after one day of placing order. It's is good and speaker is awesome . I fell down twice my desk it was not harmed. A Grade Product.Thank you Amazon
1061,Nice echo Dot powerful sound.
1062,It is not working and we want to return it and we want another alexa for free it should be working
1063,"This device is very great , this device sound quality is 3D Alexa is very intelligent, speaker is very loud sound quality is quite better than Home theatre üòä"
1064,Good experience...also like to suggest to introduce automatic intelligence updating system so that we can experience latest technology. Overall I am satisfied
1065,Alexa is superb piece of technology. But need to improve the quality of the product.
1066,Worth the money. My daughter likes it very much. Product quality is very good compared to the price. Go for it !
1067,My family always enjoy talking to alexa. Great enjoyment.
1068,"Sound quality is decent , got it @1644 , so doesn‚Äôt bother me at all at this price segment...Alexa Is Somewhere not near the expectations"
1069,It's fun to have Alexa at home..
1070,Better get advanced version
1071,Good
1072,Voice recognition is low you need to shoute alexa to respond (older generation Echo does responds well)
1073,It works well...great functionality...only lacking points is its not portable...it should have been battery based.
1074,It didn't even start. Waste of time trying on it. Provide your customers a good quality product atleast. Not satisfied this time.
1075,Alexa device is good but bulb not much used without other WiFi.Bulb is working with mobile data.
1076,"Best product from Amazon, for home use, Children's study purpose - usage of right direction will be a limitless possibility of this device."
1077,Value for money gives zero star
1078,"Favourite dialogue "" IDont Know that"".. needs improvement"
1079,good item
1080,A nice product to have in your home
1081,It is not so good. It requires a continuous wifi connection.  So it can't connect by mobile data . It is not possible to have a wifi connection all time. This is no battery inside it also need a continuous power supply.
1082,Nice product!!
1083,Very good
1084,Everything is perfect.. If you are going to purchase it.. Please check your mobile network first... It only works with the help of network...
1085,The product is great and nice. The sound out put is loud. Only one thing is you need to be a Amazon prime member to use Alexa. Without that it will not work.
1086,Device has no Bluetooth connectivity.Very disappointed.Zero performance.Device does not access any voice.
1087,"Set up is easy, works fine. I am happy while talking."
1088,"A satisfactory product from amazon.It won't support the Youtube music, it need to be updated for Alexa."
1089,The product is too cool its blue light is just killing. The voice recognition is very good. Sometimes it don't catch but it is good. Overall it's a 5star
1090,Thank You Amazon For Alexa!! She's a part of family now....
1091,Nice product
1092,"I ordered combo echo dot+ Wipro light , but received only echo dot in box never expected this from amazon"
1093,I expected a small size but its bigger surprisingly rich n loud sound u won't regret buying
1094,Not working properlyFacing issues on connection with wifi
1095,"This device is very cool, works very well and kids can learn something from it. But it has some flaws, sometimes it does not respond."
1096,Some time create problem after Bluetooth connection... Sounnd kat kar kr aata hai
1097,The media could not be loaded.
1098,Sound quality is best 10/10Alexa integration 10/8Voice Recognition 10/7Weak part is we need to speak loud to activate Alexa it doesn‚Äôt activate on Normal voice.
1099,Amazing product
1100,very good
1101,"Must have in house üè†,She is like our family member"
1102,Voice recognition
1103,Everything is great. Only I did not realize there is no battery backup on this device. Runs only on power
1104,It is a very good speaker. But the problem is that it cannot call anyone from your contact list unlike Google home mini. And the second problem is it can tell the prices of the products only available in Amazon
1105,The sound quality is best  and alexa hears all away from another room and responds very much like a real man talking... Best time pass
1106,I bought Alexa eco dot at 1999 with Wipro 7 w smart bulb. Smart deal and the quality of the eco dot is awesome.
1107,The echo dot is superb addition in my wifi speakers. It also provides lots of information to my children..
1108,Alexa is a flagship product of Amazon... It's a good product provided you can use it fully....
1109,Alexa recognition is worstAlex doesn't recognize and play wrong....
1110,Serves the purpose
1111,Great sound quality and features with updates in every aspect and if I got the option between Bluetooth speaker and Alexa  I would choose Alexa any day with no efforts Alexa makes it easy and changes mood real quick
1112,The media could not be loaded.
1113,Good product but i don't like the system of charging ...we have to keep on charge every time..if we remove charger alexa will get off...there is no battery life...while traveling we can't carry with usüòèüòèüòï
1114,I like very must being i am an officer commending rank Officer so I may use it on long duty &/or at my residence for Arties & religious bhajans.
1115,The sound quality and voice recognition is really good.Make sure you set the setting in privacy setting to delete the recordings and also you can delete your recordings on daily basis
1116,"Absolutely mind blowing device. Beautiful shape, excellent working, nice performance, verry easy use.But the problem is that no battery storage. Only working when we plugged.Otherwise it's amazing."
1117,Value for money. Happy with Alexa and the smart bulb.
1118,"Sound quality not good ,in high volume Alexa can't hear the commands.it should be inbuilt  noise cancellation system."
1119,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I Love This Product And With Smart Bulb Its Awesome üòé Best Product You Can Buy It Without Any Problem Trust Me You Won't Even Sleep Without Saying Alexa....‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
1120,"Good deal, during the sale. Got it for just 2299.00, along with a wipro smart bulb."
1121,"Nice voice, understands hindi english both, Very useful, and even controls the other compatible devices over voice.loving it"
1122,Some how I don't feel like it is worth to buy this product because it need always power and internet wifi connection and it doesnot even recognize properly
1123,I m very sad I m not able to connect Coustomer support
1124,"Great product for indoor music, daily event schedules, news updates, great companion of my 2 year old son in Lockdown."
1125,Wooweee now my home is smarter. I can control everything from Dubai.
1126,"Don'y Buy ,,,total waste of Money..Echo can't even understant what we want to say...even weather forecasting is not correct."
1127,Wow my son loved it. Hats off to Amazon. Sound quality and connectivity is amazing. Superb product
1128,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD VALUE OF MONEY BUY IT IT IS BEST PRODUCT I LOVE IT"
1129,Good initiative We can learn lots with Alexa
1130,I ordered device which displays time on it - but one delivered does not have this feature. Product is good but not delivered what was ordered.
1131,"Alexa voice is awsm really its feeling awsm to talk with alexa.Grt purchase ,if wnybody want to buy a smart speaker go blindly to choose this grt one..."
1132,So good and proper work sound quality is awesome how to explain you I have no word thank you Amazon
1133,The speaker as they claim is not that smart. It doesn't understand even the simplest of things on first attempt. Sound quality is good.
1134,It is like that we are talking with futureGood work by amazon on this price point(BIG THUMBs UP AMAZON ECO DOT 3 GEN)
1135,Poor
1136,"Great product by Amazon, I love it. It is very entertaining and a reliable machine. Thank you!"
1137,Sound quality and voice recognition are good not the best. Dumber than Google Assistant. Works nicely within Amazon ecosystem. Lag in Bluetooth audio output. Need to get smarter. No ability for continued conversation.
1138,"Most of the times I got irritated. I was telling kannada or hindi song names, and it was playing some English songs. Most of the times it happened."
1139,Look wise it was good and the sound quality was also good but there are some problems like you can't use another device's hot-spot . You only use first paired wifi. Overall i will give 4 out of 5 star
1140,"I am unable to use Alexa, getting announcement as ""SORRY I AM HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING RIGHT NOW,  PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER"". what shall I do. I am using Redmi note 5. When ever I say Alexa then it is giving above announcement.  Some one please help."

1309,Good echo dot
1310,Echo dot is best to buy because it can answer any of your questions you can also change its language if you want to.
1311,Works good. But the problem is it required internet compulsory we can't use to connect with Bluetooth for long period.
1312,Alexa is not able to recognise voice 50% of times. The sound quality is also punctured. Not a decent experience.
1313,I like the speaker a lot its very good product sound quality is far far better from google home mini but according to softwere i will give it 71 percent out of 100 its look better than googlehome mini. it has 4 mic while googlehas only 2 mic
1314,Wisely decision to get the Echo Dot
1315,A good companion..with all interesting featrues.If the fan of your room is on high speed It takes a second time to capture the command.
1316,Excellent product and good voice recognition in Hindi also.
1317,"There is no Bluetooth support for speakee, can't operate with mobile Bluetooth connectivity, no chip card slot, no pendrive slot."
1318,One word .Super useful product and must buy for every home .Its very user friendly product........
1319,"Its very nice product overall but sometimes it cant recognises the voice and integration to other enabled devices it's bit slow, plz improve Alexa app"

1321,"Sleek design, lovely flashing lights. The voice recognition is excellent, alexa integration is really a 8th wonder. The sound quality is fabulous. I am really loving & enjoying this gadget."

1347,I really love this product and I am sure that this is the best one than google nest or home mini I think this is helpful for who are confusing to buy in both alexa is the best one than google
1348,U can buy it but because it is a great smart speaker but if u need a bluetooth speaker then go some another speaker because it does not worth 2500 as a speaker
1349,It's an amazing product which is very cheap n working like awesome maestro.. Must buy product for our growing kid...better to give them Alexa not phone.
1350,Another great product by Amazon .My kid and me enjoy a lot with it.Lots of skills is fun...

1353,Liked
1354,Coustmer care won't respond for technical issues I guess.they hang up on 1st call not gud for a so big companies.
1355,The product is perfect and wonderful but I personally didn't like one thing of it that it doesn't have a battery backup. I was expecting it to be wireless and portable.

1376,At high volume sound quality is not good. Voice commands also not recognizing properly
1377,Everything as expected. Really good device. Only thing is when alexa speaks the sound clarity is not upto the mark.
1378,The most important thing about this AI controlled device is its good listener it can recognize your voice from range and provide you certain features
1379,It's a good choice to have a smart device & control your room ‚ù§Ô∏è... Go for it guys
1380,Overall a good product .Improvements - should allow music to be played through multiple bluetooth speakers n alexa at the same time.

1421,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Simply amazing... in love with Alexa"
1422,Personalized QnA is the best feature for me.Nice Audio quality and quite helpful for many other things.
1423,My Alexa not able to understand Hindi.I tried all the settings but the product is not installed with Hindi language software. It is not communicating in Hindi at all
1424,For a month is was working fine and now it has stop playing songs.
1425,"Superb product. No problem with voice recognition, easy to connect and works well even when the wifi is hazy and sound quality is also superb."

1428,Good product but not perfect.alexa know only hindi and english .it's improvement need .Dear team kindly add punjabi language

2095,I found Alexa helpful but it does need some upgrades when it comes to knowing the song names specially Bollywood song names :p
2096,Needs more skills and integrationsNeeds more smartness
